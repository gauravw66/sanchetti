        "markdown": "Our bones are living tissues that constantly perform regeneration to survive. When the formation of new bones isn’t as fast as the deterioration of old bones, we face osteoporosis.\n\n**Vulnerable Groups**\n\nWhile anybody can get osteoporosis, there are a few groups more vulnerable to the disease. For example,\n\n1. Non-Hispanic white women and Asian women who have completed menopause.\n2. People with low sex hormones (estrogen or testosterone) or high thyroid hormone levels.\n3. People who have small body frames and lesser bone mass.\n4. Aged people.\n5. People who’re underweight or have a calcium deficiency.\n6. People who have the disease running in family history.\n\n**Fractures**\n\nOsteoporosis causes our bones to become weak and brittle. So weak that even a blow or a fall can cause you a fracture. It is a silent disease, whose presence you only realise after you’ve already got a fracture.\n\nFractures of the spine, hip, or wrist are the most common types in people with osteoporosis. However, the spine or hip fractures are the most serious complications of osteoporosis since hip fractures often are caused by a fall and can result in disability and the spine is an essential part of our nervous systems.\n\n1. **Low Trauma or Fragility Fractures:** The low intensity falls or injuries that might not hurt a healthy bone but fracture a bone affected by osteoporosis. These are called low trauma or fragility fractures. Sometimes these fractures heal on their own by conservative treatment but other times you need to contact an orthopaedic surgeon. Following surgery, a physiotherapist will help train your nerves, muscles and bones post-fracture and shows exercises to get back on with your regular life.\n2. **Spine Fractures:** Since they are relatively more critical, patients with spine fractures typically receive pain medication, exercises, and a back brace or treatment for muscle spasms while they heal. While most spine fractures heal by this, more severe cases need vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty.\n\n\nUnder **vertebroplasty,** your doctor injects bone cement into your spine to stabilise it and lessen the pain. Additionally, it can prevent further fractures of the vertebrae and curvature of the spine.\n\n\nUnder **kyphoplasty,** your doctor inserts a balloon device into the fractured vertebra to help restore the height and shape of the vertebra. The device leaves a small cavity. The doctor then fills the cavity with special bone cement.\n3. **Hip Fractures:** Hip fractures are a break in the upper portion of the femur. They are highly painful and often too critical to have their surgical treatment delayed. X-rays, MRI scans or CT scans diagnose these fractures followed by treatments including surgical repair with screws, nails, or plates; a partial or total hip replacement and lastly, exercises.\n4. **Wrist Fractures:** Wrist fractures are healed simply by adding a cast or splint.\n\nPrevention is better than cure. If you’re diagnosed with osteoporosis, it’s a good idea to strengthen your bone health, change your lifestyle to prevent injuring your bones and have your eyesight checked so you don’t fall by mistake!\n\n#### Did you like this?

After discovering a lesion and weakened bone, it was later found that he had developed a BONE CYST.\n\nSancheti Hospital doctors decided to treat this cyst by placing rods inside the bone. Thus, the surgery was performed and within a period of four to five months, the bone completely healed.The happy recovered patient visited the hospital recently and it was gratifying for everyone at Sancheti Hospital to see that he has completely recovered. He can perform his daily activities and play sports with no sign of pain.\n\nNotably, with the kids, there are a lot of problems that can occur without any physical injury, or a congenital issue, therefore, our doctors at Sancheti Hospital always emphasize the importance of having a check-up done for any complaint of recurring pain.

If you experience severe pain, loss of motion or deformity of your hip joint, unable to do your activities of daily living; and the non-operative methods have not yielded the desired results; you may require hip replacement surgery.\n\nIn a [_total hip replacement surgery,_](https://sanchetihospital.org/joint-replacement-department/) the painful parts of the damaged hip are replaced with artificial hip parts called prosthesis, a device that substitutes a joint. The prosthesis consists of metal components: a socket, ball, and stem. The outer shell of the socket is usually made of metal and the inner shell consists of plastic, or ceramic: or the entire socket may be plastic. Patients suffering from a variety of hip disorders are regularly treated at Sancheti Hospital. Special importance is given to thorough analysis, treatment procedure, and use of sophisticated medical equipment.\n\n## **FAQ**\n\n#### [When will I be allowed to drive after my surgery?](\\#1531980883870-b6cc0ff2-4eef)\n\nYou can drive a four wheeler 4-8 weeks after surgery and only after consulting your surgeon.\n\n#### [Should I have a total knee replacement surgery?](\\#1531980913503-fbc2904a-b3cd)\n\nTotal knee replacement is an elective operation. The decision to have the operation is not made by the doctor, it is made by you. The doctor may recommend the operation, but your decision must be based on the problems faced by you versus the benefit you are going to get after surgery.\n\n#### [How long would the hip implant last?](\\#1531980950576-87523122-30ed)\n\nAn artificial joint can last for 10 to 15 years or even longer. However the life span is affected by the weight of the person and by his activities. An overweight person or a person actively involved in sports can wear out the artificial joint quicker than a thin or a more sedentary person. The life of the prosthesis is also dependent upon the bearing surface which is chosen. The ceramic bearing surface is at present the best as it has a low wear rate and also the particles which are given out are inert i.e. the body shows no reaction to it. This type of the prosthesis has a life of more than 20 years to 25 years in majority of the patients.\n\n#### [Should I have a total hip replacement?](\\#1531980990298-c8e82c98-5a3f)\n\nTotal hip replacement is an elective operation. The decision to have the operation is not made by the doctor, it is made by you. The doctor may recommend the operation, but your decision must be based on the problems faced by you versus the benefit you are going to get after surgery.\n\n#### [Does one require walker or stick support after joint replacement surgery?](\\#1531981013067-ba781986-98de)\n\nYes, one requires external support aids for 3-6 weeks after the operation. These walking aids are discarded in due course of time once muscle control improves.\n\n#### [How do I know if I need a hip replacement?](\\#1531981042378-c7fbc6eb-8f66)\n\nIf routine activities like getting dressed or walking are being difficult to perform, it may be time to consider a hip replacement surgery. In today’s fast changing world the patient at times chooses the hip replacement if he or she finds that the arthritic hip is coming in the way of attaining the goals of life in personal, professional and family matters. Doctors generally try to delay total hip replacement for as long as possible in favor of less invasive treatments. However in patients with advanced joint disease, hip replacement offers the chance for relief from pain and a return to normal activities.\n\n#### [How long does recovery and rehabilitation take?](\\#1531981072584-1d373d60-b8d3)\n\nGenerally patients have to spend maximum 3 to 5 days in the hospital after hip replacement surgery. Full recovery takes about 3 to 6 months; however, it depends on the type of surgery, your overall health, and your own participation in the success of your rehabilitation.\n\n#### [How long do I have to exercise?](\\#1531981104936-2df69562-be37)\n\nPlease remember that you make your joint move around. The target is to have a good strength in the patient to allow for desired walking and other activities. For this a scheduled and proactive exercise schedule should be followed.\n\n![Dr. K.H.

This caused severe pain in his back, hindered his mobility, and he was entirely bed-ridden.\n\nAfter examining his condition, Dr. Ajay Kothari and the team decided to treat him via VERTEBROPLASTY, which involves strengthening of the bone with the use of Bone Cement. Within two hours of the procedure, the patient stood up and started walking with his pain completely gone.\n\nThe patient is now completely recovered and enjoys his morning walks more than ever. Despite his age, the team at Sancheti, with a meticulously thought-about procedure, got him back on the track!\n\nIf there is a long course of treatment, then regular monitoring of liver and kidney function and blood picture (peripheral) is required. In patients who use anticoagulants together with [Ambien (Zolpidem)](https://holisticdental.org/ambien-treat-insomnia/), it is necessary to regularly take tests for the values of the clotting blood system.\n\nTruly, medical science has advanced beyond imagination and is helping patients heal as quickly as possible with minimally invasive procedures.

        "markdown": "It’s ice cream and lemonade season! But it’s also the season of heat waves, sunburn and dehydration. To live this summer to its fullest, the following are some tips to stay hydrated:\n\n1. **Drink water:** Water makes up 60% of our body. It stimulates biochemical reactions, discards waste, stabilises the heartbeat, supplies nutrients to all organs, maintains body temperature, aids digestion, forestalls constipation, enhances blood circulation, and cushions our joints and tissues. All of these tasks come to a halt when you don’t drink water, or rather enough of it. Our body requires more water than usual during hot summers, so ensuring at least 13 cups of water daily is indispensable. Mobilising multiple sources of hydration is how one can live in hot HYDRATED summers.\n2. **Cooling down:** Staying hydrated is more than just drinking water; it means modulating your body temperature. During hot summers, we are more vulnerable to heatstroke. It’s essential to avoid overheating your body by consuming liquids at regular breaks, wearing light and loose-fitting clothes, avoiding dark-coloured clothes, and staying indoors during the afternoons when the sun is high. Don’t forget to pack a water bottle wherever you go this summer vacation.\n3. **Steer clear of anti-hydrating liquids:** Liquids like coffee, energy drinks, sugary soda, beer, alcohol, lemonade, flavoured milk, smoothies, and sweet tea do the opposite of hydration. They contain sugar, sodium, and other ingredients that dehydrate our tissues, and avoiding such liquids is advisable by experts at Sancheti Hospital, Pune. If we have them anyway, drinking enough water after finishing them is recommended.\n4. **Fancy water:** Plain old H2O may sound tedious. Sometimes adding a little razzle-dazzle to your water is vital to keeping you hydrated. Slices of lemon, lime and oranges make your glass look more inviting, enhancing its taste by infusing the water with fresh berries, pineapples, lemon, and cucumber. One can even freeze them inside ice cubes and plop them in the drink as one goes. Fresh mint leaves, basil, ginger, rosemary or cilantro also add a rejuvenating glow to our water. These natural preservative-free flavours will make you feel like a flamboyant health guru.\n5. **Eating water:** Devouring the right food can make up 20% of the water intake of your body. Coconut water is a mineral-rich drink high in magnesium, sodium, potassium, and calcium; it quickly replaces lost fluids and electrolytes caused by exertion and hot weather. Eating oats in the morning can keep you hydrated till lunchtime as oats expand and absorb water. Watermelon, strawberries, cantaloupe, peaches, oranges, skim milk, cucumber, and lettuce are some foods with more than 90% water content.\n\nExperts at Sancheti have suggested that dehydration can have vast ill effects like sleepiness, headache, light-headedness, burning urine, decreased elasticity, dry skin, high heart rate, and low blood pressure. The heat waves cause more sweat, leading to substantial water loss; drinking ample water and taking cold showers calm our muscles and prevent us from sweating a lot. Don’t forget to replenish yourself before, during, and after your hot summer body workout!\n\n#### Did you like this?

        "markdown": "**World Alzheimer’s Day**, observed on September 21, helps spread awareness about Alzheimer’s disease, its symptoms, and treatment options. Alzheimer’s is a progressive brain disorder that leads to the decline of memory, cognitive function, and reasoning. Here’s an overview of the **symptoms** and **treatment options** associated with Alzheimer’s disease:\n\n### **Symptoms of Alzheimer’s Disease:**\n\nAlzheimer’s disease progresses through different stages, with early, middle, and late-stage symptoms. Common symptoms include:\n\n1. **Memory Loss:**\n   - Forgetting recent conversations, names, or events, especially in the early stages.\n   - Difficulty recalling important information, repeating questions or stories.\n2. **Cognitive Impairment:**\n   - Problems with concentration, planning, and problem-solving.\n   - Difficulty performing familiar tasks (e.g., cooking, using devices, managing finances).\n3. **Confusion and Disorientation:**\n   - Getting lost in familiar places.\n   - Confusion about time, places, or people.\n4. **Language Problems:**\n   - Struggling to find the right words or follow conversations.\n   - Speaking in incomplete sentences or repeating phrases.\n5. **Behavioral and Mood Changes:**\n   - Increased anxiety, depression, mood swings, irritability.\n   - Social withdrawal and loss of interest in activities.\n6. **Poor Judgment and Decision-Making:**\n   - Difficulty making decisions, such as managing money or assessing risk.\n   - Vulnerability to scams due to poor judgment.\n7. **Changes in Physical Abilities:**\n   - Loss of motor skills, like walking or coordinating movement (in advanced stages).\n   - Trouble with swallowing and controlling bladder or bowel movements (late stage).\n\n### **Treatment Options for Alzheimer’s Disease:**\n\nWhile there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease, treatment focuses on managing symptoms and slowing disease progression. Treatment options include:\n\n#### **Medications:**\n\n1. **Cholinesterase Inhibitors:**\n   - Drugs like **Donepezil (Aricept), Rivastigmine (Exelon), and Galantamine (Razadyne)**.\n   - These work by increasing levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in memory and learning.\n   - Effective in mild to moderate stages.\n2. **Memantine (Namenda):**\n   - Used for moderate to severe Alzheimer’s.\n   - Works by regulating glutamate, a chemical that, in excess, can damage brain cells.\n3. **Combination Therapy:**\n   - Some patients benefit from a combination of cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine.\n4. **Newer Drugs:**\n   - Recent FDA-approved drugs like **Aducanumab (Aduhelm)**, which target amyloid plaques, thought to contribute to Alzheimer’s. These are controversial and still under evaluation.\n\n#### **Non-Drug Treatments:**\n\n1. **Cognitive Therapy:**\n   - Cognitive stimulation therapy (CST) may help with memory, language, and social interaction.\n2. **Lifestyle Changes:**\n   - Healthy diet, regular physical exercise, and staying mentally active can reduce the risk or delay the onset.\n   - Brain games, puzzles, and other activities that engage memory and problem-solving can help maintain cognitive function.\n3. **Psychological and Behavioral Therapies:**\n   - Therapy can help manage mood changes, anxiety, and depression, improving quality of life.\n4. **Caregiver Support and Counseling:**\n   - Support groups, educational programs, and counseling help caregivers manage stress, improve communication, and provide the necessary care for Alzheimer’s patients.\n\n#### **Advanced Therapies:**\n\n1. **Occupational Therapy:**\n   - Helps patients adjust to changes in cognitive function by teaching them to perform tasks safely.\n   - Modifications to the living environment can also help (e.g., labeling drawers, simplifying tasks).\n2. **Speech Therapy:**\n   - For patients with communication problems, speech therapists can help improve language skills or find alternative communication methods.\n3. **Future Treatments:**\n   - Ongoing research is exploring gene therapies, vaccines, and new drugs aimed at the underlying causes, like beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles.\n\n#### **Supportive Care:**\n\n1. **Caregiver Training:**\n   - Caregivers learn strategies to assist with daily tasks, manage behavior, and maintain the patient’s independence as long as possible.\n2. **End-of-Life Care:**\n   - In late stages, palliative and hospice care focus on comfort, dignity, and quality of life.\n\nEarly detection is key in managing Alzheimer’s more effectively.\n\n4o\n\n#### Did you like this?

A regular quality control and quality assurance of these equipment is performed by the research coordinators.\n- The research patients’ source files are maintained and the source documentation is completed on a timely basis. The data is kept under lock and key in a secure place with limited access to maintain confidentiality of the data.\n- Notifying the Ethics Committee by submitting a periodic progress report of the trials conducted. Other submissions including the DCGI approvals, protocol and ICF amendments, serious adverse events, etc are done on timely basis thus keeping the EC updated.\n- Temperature logs are maintained for the deep freezer where the investigational product (IP) is stored to ensure there is no temperature excursion occurring at the site.\n- A check list of all the investigational products, laboratory kits, the packaging material, temperature data loggers is maintained at the site. This helps to locate IP box and identify used or expired kits or boxes.\n- Maintaining the patient visit schedules as per protocol. The patients are followed and a reminder call 3 days prior and then again one day prior to their scheduled visit has helped us achieve 0% lost to follow-up and missed visits at our site.\n- Strict adherence to this schedule is a part of our protocol and this has helped the sponsor to have a clean and valid data from our site.\n- Telephone log is maintained which provides details of the time and date of the call, person called and issues discussed.\n\n### Quality Assurance\n\nThe department assures quality by having monthly internal audits as well as audits from different sponsors routinely.\n\nBeing regularly scrutinized by external monitors ensures the accuracy in data. The quality of data is an example of one of the best research sites in India.\n\n![Sancheti Hospital_Vision](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Vision-IMG-002.jpg)\n\n### The Academic Research Division\n\nThe Academic Research Division is involved in the co-ordination of academic research and publications.\n\n#### Dr. Ashok Shyam\n\nHead of Academic Research Division\n\n#### Mrs. Chaitali Deshmukh\n\nResearch Data Co-ordinator\n\n#### **Mrs. Neha Pancholi**\n\nResearch Data Co-ordinator\n\n#### **Ms. Rupali Kavhale**\n\nResearch Data Co-ordinator\n\nThe department is involved in the design of study protocol. With emerging trends in orthopaedic, it ensures that the studies conducted at the institute deal with the questions faced today with the present standard of care in Orthopaedic. All study protocols are designed based on the latest review of literature.\n\nThe research data is collected according to these various protocols and patients, both on out-patient department (OPD) as well as in-patient department (IPD) basis are asked to provide the information related to their clinical condition.\n\nThe relevant clinical history, surgical details, various orthopaedic scores are also obtained from the patients’ medical records, the operation theatre notes, discharge summaries, their surgeons, residents, etc.\n\nThe quality of life questionnaires are administered to each operated patient at specific intervals during their hospital stay and subsequently during follow-up visits in the OPDs. The real time data including the visual analogue scale (VAS), ambulatory status, orthopaedic scores and quality of life questionnaires are of utmost importance in achieving a clean and valid data and thus addressing the research question.\n\nThe research data coordinators are placed at different OPD cubicles such as trauma, spine, paediatric, cold, and arthroplasty. Data is collected from all the patients including those for follow-up after surgeries.\n\nThe data collected is then entered into a secure electronic data capture system which is accessible only to research team members. The master charts are designed and organized according to the research protocols and the data collected is entered into the master charts according to patients’ visit.\n\nA record of all the scanograms conducted at the institute has been maintained.\n\nIt becomes easier and readily accessible to the researchers who save a lot of time as data collection and then collation of the data into a well designed master chart is a lot more time consuming than the final review and publication of research papers. This has greatly helped the researchers to have a number of publications within a short span of time.\n\nWith a coordinated system in place and great team work the department ensures that every condition is a potential publication\n\n![Sancheti Hospital](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/research.jpg)\n\n![Sancheti Hospital](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/research1.jpg)\n\n![Sancheti Hospital](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/research2.jpg)\n\n![Sancheti Hospital](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/research3.jpg)\n\n![research4](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/research4-300x186.jpg)\n\n![Sancheti Hospital](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/research5.jpg)\n\n### Academics\n\n#### Sancheti Institute – Excellence in Higher Education\n\nThe Sancheti institute since 1974 has been a recognized post graduate training center for orthopaedic surgery.

Prompt recognition and treatment are crucial, as strokes can lead to permanent brain damage or death if not addressed quickly. Here’s what each letter in **BE FAST** stands for:\n\n### **B – Balance:**\n\n- **Signs:** Sudden loss of balance or coordination, dizziness, or difficulty walking.\n- **What to do:** Ask the person if they are feeling dizzy or unsteady.\n\n### **E – Eyes:**\n\n- **Signs:** Sudden trouble seeing, blurred or double vision, or loss of vision in one or both eyes.\n- **What to do:** Ask if the person is having trouble with their eyesight or if things look blurry or distorted.\n\n### **F – Face Drooping:**\n\n- **Signs:** One side of the face may droop or feel numb. The smile may appear uneven or lopsided.\n- **What to do:** Ask the person to smile and check if one side of their face droops.\n\n### **A – Arm Weakness:**\n\n- **Signs:** Sudden weakness or numbness in one arm (or leg), usually on one side of the body.\n- **What to do:** Ask the person to raise both arms. Observe if one arm drifts downward or is unable to rise.\n\n### **S – Speech Difficulty:**\n\n- **Signs:** Sudden trouble speaking, slurred speech, or difficulty understanding speech.\n- **What to do:** Ask the person to repeat a simple sentence (e.g., “The sky is blue”). Check if their speech is slurred or if they have difficulty forming words.\n\n### **T – Time to Call 911:**\n\n- **Action:** If any of the above signs are present, it’s time to **call emergency services immediately**.\n- **What to do:** Every minute counts during a stroke, so seeking prompt medical treatment can make a significant difference in recovery and survival.\n\n### Why BE FAST Matters:\n\n- **Strokes** are medical emergencies that occur when blood flow to part of the brain is interrupted (ischemic stroke) or when a blood vessel in the brain bursts (hemorrhagic stroke).\n- Quick treatment can help reduce brain damage and improve outcomes, such as using **clot-busting drugs (thrombolytics)**, which are most effective within the first few hours of the onset of symptoms.\n\nBy remembering **BE FAST**, you can act quickly and potentially save a life or prevent long-term disability in someone experiencing a stroke.\n\n4o\n\n#### Did you like this?

        "markdown": "Have you ever felt like the world around you is spinning out of control, even when you’re perfectly still? Welcome to the enigmatic world of vertigo. Vertigo, often misunderstood as a fear of heights, is a complex neurological condition that disrupts our sense of balance and spatial orientation. In this article, we delve into the depths of vertigo, exploring its causes, treatments, precautions, and the role of neuroscience in unraveling its mysteries.\n\n**Causes of Vertigo**\n\n1. **Inner Ear Disorders:**\n\nThe inner ear comprises delicate structures crucial for balance, including the semicircular canals and the cochlea. Disorders affecting the inner ear, such as Meniere’s disease, disrupt the normal fluid balance within these structures, leading to vertigo episodes. Meniere’s disease is characterized by fluid build-up in the inner ear, causing pressure changes that result in vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. Vestibular neuritis, another inner ear disorder, involves inflammation of the vestibular nerve, often triggered by viral infections. This inflammation disrupts the transmission of balance signals to the brain, resulting in vertigo spells.\n\n2. **Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)**\n\n    BPPV is the most common form of vertigo, typically triggered by specific head movements. Within the inner ear’s semicircular canals, tiny calcium carbonate crystals called otoliths or canaliths can become dislodged and accumulate in the wrong part of the canal. These displaced crystals interfere with the normal flow of fluid within the semicircular canals, sending false signals to the brain about head movement, leading to vertigo spells.\n\n3. **Neurological Issues**\n\nVertigo can also stem from neurological conditions affecting the brain and its associated structures. Migraines, for instance, can cause vertigo as a symptom, often referred to as vestibular migraines. These migraines may involve abnormal activity in the brain’s vestibular pathways, leading to vertigo episodes. More severe neurological issues such as strokes or tumors affecting the brainstem or cerebellum can disrupt the brain’s ability to process balance signals, resulting in vertigo.\n\n4. **Medication Side Effects**\n\nCertain medications, particularly those affecting the inner ear or the brain’s neurotransmitter levels, can induce vertigo as a side effect. Examples include certain antibiotics, antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants, and medications used to treat high blood pressure. These medications can interfere with the normal functioning of the vestibular system or disrupt the brain’s ability to process balance signals, leading to vertigo symptoms.\n\n**Treatment Options**\n\n1. **Vestibular Rehabilitation Therapy (VRT)**\n\nVRT is a structured program administered by trained therapists to address vertigo and balance issues. It involves exercises tailored to each patient’s specific needs, focusing on enhancing the brain’s ability to compensate for vestibular deficits. These exercises may include head movements, eye exercises, balance training, and habituation exercises aimed at desensitizing the vestibular system to motion-related stimuli. VRT aims to improve balance, reduce dizziness and vertigo symptoms, and enhance overall quality of life for individuals affected by vestibular disorders.\n\n2. **Canalith Repositioning Maneuvers**\n\nCanalith repositioning maneuvers, such as the Epley maneuver or the Semont maneuver, are highly effective treatments for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). These maneuvers involve specific head and body movements designed to reposition displaced calcium crystals (canaliths) within the inner ear’s semicircular canals. By guiding the movement of these particles back to their proper location, canalith repositioning maneuvers alleviate vertigo symptoms and restore normal vestibular function. These maneuvers are often performed by healthcare professionals but can also be taught for self-administration at home under proper guidance.\n\n3. **Medications**\n\nMedications may be prescribed to manage vertigo symptoms or address underlying causes, depending on the individual’s diagnosis and medical history. Antihistamines such as meclizine or diphenhydramine can help alleviate vertigo and associated nausea by stabilizing the vestibular system. Antiemetics like promethazine or ondansetron may be prescribed to relieve nausea and vomiting accompanying vertigo episodes. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam or lorazepam may be used to reduce anxiety associated with vertigo or to suppress vestibular symptoms.\n\n4. **Surgery**\n\nSurgical intervention is typically considered when other treatments have failed to provide relief or in cases of severe vertigo due to structural abnormalities or tumors. Surgical procedures may involve repairing inner ear structures, removing tumors compressing the vestibular nerve, or severing the nerve to alleviate vertigo symptoms.\n\nWhile surgery carries risks and is usually reserved as a last resort, it can be beneficial for patients with debilitating vertigo unresponsive to conservative treatments.\n\n**Precautions and Lifestyle Adjustments**\n\n1. **Avoid Triggers**\n\nVertigo triggers vary from person to person but commonly include sudden head movements, rapid changes in position, and environments with excessive visual or motion stimuli. Individuals experiencing vertigo should identify their specific triggers and take proactive measures to avoid or minimize exposure to them. This may involve modifying daily activities, such as avoiding rapid head turns or crowded, visually stimulating spaces, to reduce the likelihood of vertigo episodes.\n\n2. **Stay Hydrated**\n\nAdequate hydration is crucial for overall health and can also help mitigate vertigo symptoms. Dehydration can disrupt the balance of electrolytes in the body, affecting the function of the inner ear and exacerbating vertigo. Individuals prone to vertigo should ensure they drink enough water throughout the day to maintain proper hydration levels and support vestibular function.\n\n3. **Mindful Movement**\n\nDuring vertigo episodes or when feeling dizzy, it’s essential to move cautiously and mindfully to prevent falls or injuries. Rapid movements, sudden changes in position, or standing up too quickly can trigger or worsen vertigo symptoms. Practicing deliberate and controlled movements, such as rising from a seated position slowly or using handrails for stability, can help minimize dizziness and reduce the risk of accidents.\n\n4. **Stress Management**\n\nStress and anxiety can exacerbate vertigo symptoms by heightening sensitivity to sensory inputs and increasing muscle tension. Implementing stress management techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation, can help alleviate anxiety and promote relaxation. By reducing stress levels, individuals may experience a decrease in the frequency or intensity of vertigo episodes and better cope with the challenges associated with this condition.\n\n**The Role of Neuroscience**\n\n1. **Understanding the Vestibular System**\n\nThe vestibular system, located within the inner ear, is responsible for maintaining balance, spatial orientation, and coordination of head and eye movements. Neuroscience plays a crucial role in elucidating the complex neural pathways and sensory integration mechanisms involved in processing vestibular information. Researchers explore how signals from the vestibular organs are transmitted to the brainstem and cerebellum, where they are integrated with visual and proprioceptive inputs to maintain equilibrium.\n\n2. **Advanced Imaging Techniques**\n\nNeuroscientists employ various imaging modalities, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to visualize brain structures and activity associated with vertigo. These techniques allow researchers to map brain regions involved in vestibular processing, identify abnormalities in patients with vertigo, and monitor changes in neural activity following treatment interventions.\n\n3. **Neurophysiological Studies**\n\nElectrophysiological studies, including electroencephalography (EEG), vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP), and electronystagmography (ENG), provide valuable insights into the electrical activity of the vestibular system and its connections with other brain regions. By recording neural responses to vestibular stimuli, researchers can investigate sensory processing deficits in individuals with vertigo and develop targeted therapeutic approaches to address these impairments.\n\n4. **Research in Leading Journals**\n\nScientific journals like Nature Neuroscience serve as prominent platforms for publishing cutting-edge research on the neurobiology of vertigo. Studies published in these journals elucidate the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms underlying vestibular function and dysfunction. By disseminating groundbreaking discoveries and fostering collaboration among researchers and clinicians, these journals drive innovation and facilitate the translation of basic science findings into clinical applications.\n\nVertigo may disrupt our sense of equilibrium, but with the combined efforts of medical science, physical therapy, and a deeper understanding of the neurological mechanisms at play, we can regain our balance and navigate life’s whirlwinds with confidence. By shedding light on the causes, treatments, and precautions associated with vertigo, we empower individuals to take control of their health and seek appropriate care when needed. Let’s continue to explore the fascinating intersection of neuroscience and vertigo, unlocking new insights and forging pathways towards a world where dizziness no longer holds us back from experiencing life to the fullest.\n\n#### Did you like this?

        "markdown": "# Patient Cases\n\nA 24-year old female, who had undergone a total hip replacement surgery on the left side at a different Medical facility three months ago, came to Sancheti Hospital with swelling and pain on the same side of the hip joint while also being treated for SICKLE CELL ANEMIA.\n\nUpon performing an X-ray, it was discovered that the patient had a fractured femur bone in the left leg, developed after the implant. It was a case of FEMUR PERIPROSTHETIC FRACTURE, which was then corrected by FEMORAL STEM REVISION SURGERY to fix the tilted Corail stem which was the implant that connected the femur to the hip bone. It was straightened and brought in union with the femur bone.\n\nThe patient has shown great recovery post-surgery. She is walking independently without pain and can now ride her two-wheeler for short distances.\n\nWhen taking [Xanax (Alprazolam)](https://holisticdental.org/xanax-treat-anxiety/), like other benzodiazepines, side effects such as difficulty concentrating, confusion, agitation, hallucinations, and reactions such as irritability, agitation, anger attacks, aggressive or hostile behavior are rarely reported.\n\nPost-operative care is just as crucial and is a must to ensure a speedy recovery. With mishaps like these, it is very important to give proper attention to the joint after surgery and also take immediate measures when things go south. Regardless, Sancheti Hospital is here for you!\n\nToo much PATIENCE can make you a PATIENT!\n\nSuffering for over 15 years from severe knee pain, a patient from Jhansi, who finally came to Sancheti Hospital for an opinion, was diagnosed with the OSTEOARTHRITIS of the KNEES. She had been suffering for so long, that eventually her mobility was impeded to the extent where she couldn’t even perform her daily activities.\n\nAfter examining the patient thoroughly, Dr. Kailash Patil, Dr. Parag Sancheti, and their team decided to make use of extension rods and perform a surgery to replace her knees. Post the operation and further observation, she was discharged within a short span of under a week, and she returned home in excellent condition.\n\nThe orthopedic and rehabilitation team at Sancheti Hospital made sure that the patient was treated well with physiotherapy, which in turn made her pain vanish fully. 10 months later, the patient has recovered completely, and she is back to her routine all glad and grateful!\n\nThe intake of Valium (even in therapeutic dosages) can lead to the development of addiction, as well as physical and mental dependence. The larger the doses and the longer the treatment, the higher the risk of developing addiction. The latter also increases in patients with drug and alcohol dependence in history. For more information about the drug, visit [https://www.pharmacybc.com/valium-diazepam/](https://www.pharmacybc.com/valium-diazepam/).\n\nOur team at Sancheti Hospital advises a quick checkup whenever you sense pain, more so with the problems that are prevalent with age. In any case, our experienced doctors, along with their expertise and the latest technologies, are always here to serve you!\n\nRecently, a patient, 78 years of age, came in with a case of weakened bones which had led to a fracture in the spine. This caused severe pain in his back, hindered his mobility, and he was entirely bed-ridden.\n\nAfter examining his condition, Dr. Ajay Kothari and the team decided to treat him via VERTEBROPLASTY, which involves strengthening of the bone with the use of Bone Cement. Within two hours of the procedure, the patient stood up and started walking with his pain completely gone.\n\nThe patient is now completely recovered and enjoys his morning walks more than ever. Despite his age, the team at Sancheti, with a meticulously thought-about procedure, got him back on the track!\n\nIf there is a long course of treatment, then regular monitoring of liver and kidney function and blood picture (peripheral) is required. In patients who use anticoagulants together with [Ambien (Zolpidem)](https://holisticdental.org/ambien-treat-insomnia/), it is necessary to regularly take tests for the values of the clotting blood system.\n\nTruly, medical science has advanced beyond imagination and is helping patients heal as quickly as possible with minimally invasive procedures. We, at Sancheti Hospital, always yearn to learn about and implement the latest technologies, and we can, therefore, offer the most suitable treatment.\n\nA few years ago, an 8-year-old boy, with no recent injury or accident, was brought in by his parents with pain in his right arm. After discovering a lesion and weakened bone, it was later found that he had developed a BONE CYST.\n\nSancheti Hospital doctors decided to treat this cyst by placing rods inside the bone. Thus, the surgery was performed and within a period of four to five months, the bone completely healed.The happy recovered patient visited the hospital recently and it was gratifying for everyone at Sancheti Hospital to see that he has completely recovered. He can perform his daily activities and play sports with no sign of pain.\n\nNotably, with the kids, there are a lot of problems that can occur without any physical injury, or a congenital issue, therefore, our doctors at Sancheti Hospital always emphasize the importance of having a check-up done for any complaint of recurring pain. A timely diagnosis can save them from big trouble later.\n\n![Sunday OPD](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sunday-opd.jpg)\n\n×"

        "markdown": "If surgery is in the near future, you might be curious about how to recuperate more rapidly, get back to work more quickly and get back to the gym faster. Although your “want for speed” may be strong, keep in mind that the quality of your recovery is also essential. The following advice may be helpful to you as you try to resume your life after surgery:\n\n1. **Listen to your healthcare provider:** Patients often disregard those instructions that may cause inconvenience in their lifestyle. Taking a sponge bath, staying home from work, not sitting cross-legged, not lifting heavier weights, or not bending from the back may all seem abnormal to your craving to return to everyday life. Still, all in all, the rest is significantly more important. Doing too much too soon will lead you back to square one.\n2. **Infection and inspection:** The best way to get rid of surgical aftermath is to take care of your wound and prevent it from being infected. Surgical site infections may happen within 30 days after surgery. It is essential to wash your hands before touching your wound and keep the area surrounding it clean. It might not be the best sight to look at but inspect your incision several times a day to ensure the stitches are intact and there is no wound drainage.\n3. **Eating means healing:** It is common to lose appetite after surgery, but remember that eating implies healing. Your body needs the correct fuel to amp up the recovery. You might feel nauseous, constipated, or simply not hungry, but make sure you stay hydrated and consume a healthy diet. Modifying your diet will take you a long way past common complications and unnecessary side effects of anaesthesia.\n4. **Move:** Take a short stroll around your house every hour to relieve yourself. Walking will help you avoid major issues, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT), blood clots, and pneumonia. Walking is an excellent approach to start exercising again. Additionally, it makes it simpler to return to your routine once you’ve recovered. You can begin engaging in more physical activity two to four weeks after the beginning of the treatment. Following surgery, regular check-ups and rehabilitation sessions are pretty helpful. It prevents post-operative problems while also continuously monitoring your progress.\n5. **Know When to Seek Your Doctor:** Discomfort is a certainty after surgery. Patients, however, often object to taking antibiotics because they worry about developing a drug addiction or because they dislike how they feel after taking prescription medications. Failure to take prescribed post-surgical medications may cause some complications. It’s necessary to call your healthcare provider if you experience an excruciating amount of pain. If you’re bleeding or having trouble breathing, can’t keep food or water down, have difficulty urinating, or have obvious signs of infection, immediately seek help from the [healthcare provider](https://sanchetihospital.org/) in Sancheti.\n\nRemember that the success of your recovery largely depends on how carefully you follow your post-op instructions, which are very precisely given to each patient in Sancheti Hospital.\n\n#### Did you like this?

But, today just having a spine is not enough; it also needs to be free from injuries and deformities. Spine problems are increasing each day at an alarming rate. These spine problems can occur and affect any point in the complex spinal bone structure. They start taking roots with the simplest of things like improper postures, lack of stretching, improper beds, etc. Today we have Dr. Shailesh Hadgaonkar simplifying human spine for us, debarring some common myths and misconceptions. So, stay tuned, know your spine better, so that you can always walk upright! Dr. Shailesh Hadgaonkar is Unit head of the Sancheti Spine Department.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n### 1\\. When can one bend/sit after surgery?\n\nYou can’t bend your hip beyond 60 to 90 degrees up to 12 weeks after surgery. It would help if you did not bow to pick things and did not cross your legs and ankles while sitting. After 12 weeks, your body will start adapting, and you can slowly return to your routine.\n\n### 2\\. When can one drive after surgery?\n\nIt is best if you avoid driving up to 12 weeks after your surgery. Even if you are travelling in a car, doctors recommend doing it after at least 48 hours of your surgery.\n\n### 3\\. How soon can you work out after surgery?\n\nYou can’t involve in any exercises after 48 hours of surgery. Slowly, after two weeks and based on your recovery, doctors may recommend customised exercise plans that don’t completely exhaust you. You can follow your old exercise regime after 14 weeks of the operation.\n\n### 4\\. What nutrition to consume for recovery?\n\nIncreasing your protein intake will help, especially after spine surgery. The calories you obtain after the operation must be from eggs, paneer, tofu, poultry, fish, and meat, and you can also include foods rich in calcium and Vitamin D.\n\n### 5\\. When should you come for follow-ups?\n\nYou can visit your doctor after four to six weeks after your surgery. After that, you must follow up every few months to two years, based on your surgeon’s advice.\n\n### 6\\. What are the precautions for post-surgery care?\n\nTry to keep the wound clean after your surgery. Your operated area will require new dressing once in a while, so try to keep that region dry. If the swelling does not decrease, ensure that you speak to your doctor immediately.\n\n### 7\\. How essential is physiotherapy after spine surgery?\n\nOne of the ways to reduce post-operative pain is through physiotherapy. Specific exercises will be recommended to recover faster and return to everyday life soon.\n\n### 8\\. How can Sancheti Hospital help you?\n\nFor a quick and successful recovery from all your spine and back problems, experts at Sancheti will try to cure them through non-surgical procedures. If you need surgery, the best minimally-invasive techniques are available to treat your medical conditions, and you will be on a speedy recovery.\n\n![Sunday OPD](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sunday-opd.jpg)\n\n×"

        "markdown": "Our feet are the foundation of our bodies and carry us through our daily activities. However, foot pain is a common problem that affects millions of people worldwide. Foot pain can be caused by a variety of factors, and understanding the root cause of discomfort is essential for finding the right treatment. Here, we explore the top causes of foot pain and what measures can be taken to avoid it.\n\n**Causes of Foot Pain**\n\n1. **Dry skin**\n\n\nDry skin is a common cause of foot pain, especially during the winter months. When the skin on our feet becomes too dry, it can crack, leading to pain and discomfort. To avoid this, it is essential to keep your feet moisturised regularly. Apply a moisturiser specifically designed for feet at least twice a day, and avoid using products that contain harsh chemicals that can dry out your skin further.\n2. **Extra weight**\n\n\nCarrying excess weight puts a lot of pressure on your feet, which can cause pain and discomfort. Obesity is a significant risk factor for foot pain, as it increases the strain on the bones, joints, and ligaments in the feet. Losing weight can reduce the pressure on your feet and alleviate pain. Regular exercise and a balanced diet can help you achieve a healthy weight and improve your overall foot health.\n3. **Cold weather**\n\n\nCold weather can also contribute to foot pain, as it causes the blood vessels in our feet to constrict, reducing circulation. This can lead to pain, numbness, and even frostbite in extreme cases. To avoid this, wear warm socks and appropriate footwear when going outside during the winter months. Invest in a good pair of insulated boots with good grip and traction to avoid slipping on icy surfaces.\n4. **Inappropriate footwear**\n\n\nWearing inappropriate footwear is one of the most common causes of foot pain. Shoes that are too tight, loose, or lack support can cause pain, blisters, and other foot problems. It is essential to choose shoes that fit properly, have good arch support, and are appropriate for the activity you are doing. High heels are notorious for causing foot pain, so limit your use of them and wear them only for special occasions.\n5. **Lower circulation**\n\n\nPoor circulation in the feet can cause pain, numbness, and cramping. Diabetes, peripheral artery disease, and other medical conditions can result in poor circulation in the feet. If you have a medical condition that affects circulation, it is essential to work with your healthcare provider to manage the condition and improve circulation in your feet.\n\n**Measures to Avoid Foot Pain**\n\nNow that we understand the common causes of foot pain let us explore some measures that can help you avoid it:\n\n- Wear comfortable and appropriate footwear for the activity you are doing. Invest in good quality shoes that fit well and provide adequate support.\n- Keep your feet moisturized to prevent dry skin and cracking.\n- Maintain a healthy weight to reduce pressure on your feet.\n- Exercise regularly to improve circulation and strengthen the muscles in your feet.\n- Avoid walking barefoot on hard surfaces.\n\nIf you have a medical condition that affects your feet, work with your healthcare provider to manage the condition.\n\n**How Sancheti Hospital Helps You**\n\n[Sancheti Hospital](https://sanchetihospital.org/) is a leading healthcare provider that specializes in orthopaedic care, including foot and ankle pain. The hospital has a team of highly skilled and experienced doctors who use the latest technology and techniques to provide the best possible care to their patients. Sancheti Hospital offers a comprehensive range of services for foot pain, including diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation.\n\n**When to Consult a Foot Doctor?**\n\nIf you are experiencing sudden or chronic foot pain, it is essential to consult a foot doctor. A foot doctor can diagnose the root cause of pain and develop a treatment plan to help alleviate your symptoms. You should also see a foot doctor if you have any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or drainage from a wound on your foot. Additionally, if you have diabetes or other medical conditions that affect your feet, you should have regular check-ups with a foot doctor to monitor your foot health.\n\n**People Also Ask**\n\n- **Why is foot pain so common in the winter?**\n\n\nFoot pain is common in the winter because freezing weather can cause the blood vessels in our feet to constrict, reducing circulation. This can lead to pain, numbness, and even frostbite in extreme cases. Additionally, wearing inappropriate footwear in the winter, such as shoes without adequate traction, can increase the risk of slips and falls, which can lead to foot injuries and pain.\n- **How do you treat your feet in winter?**\n\n\nTo treat your feet in winter, it is essential to keep them warm and moisturised. Wear warm socks and appropriate footwear when going outside, and apply a moisturiser specifically designed for feet at least twice a day to prevent dry skin and cracking.\n- **Why does cold weather increase my risk of foot problems?**\n\n\nCold weather increases the risk of foot problems because it causes the blood vessels in our feet to constrict, reducing circulation. This can lead to pain, numbness, and even frostbite in extreme cases. Additionally, wearing inappropriate footwear in the winter, such as shoes without adequate traction, can increase the risk of slips and falls, which can lead to foot injuries and pain.\n\n#### Did you like this?

These tumours may be in the bone or the adjoining muscles; they may have started primarily in the bone or any other organ and then may have spread to the bone.\n\nThey could be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). It takes a big team of doctors from various specialities to diagnose and treat them in the correct manner. Sancheti Hospital offers state-of-the-art facilities for the same in form of a multi disciplinary team and trained doctors in the field of orthopaedic oncology.\n\n![Sancheti Hospital](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Oncology-img-01.jpg)\n\n# Medical **Oncology**\n\nToday, thanks to the advances in the field of medical oncology, more than 50% of patients with bone cancers can be cured. Indigenously manufactured megaprosthesis i.e. artificial joints to reconstruct defects resulting after tumours excision, have made limb salvage surgery in bone tumours affordable for the general masses. It means that with advances in treatment, there is no need of amputating most of the limbs with bone cancers. The department of orthopaedic oncology at Sancheti Hospital brings the latest in management of these complex tumours to the city.\n\n## ONCOLOGY\n\nThis particular field also deals with treatment of many other benign bony conditions namely giant cell tumours, bony cysts, fibrous dysplasias, osteochondromas, enchondromas. Patient suffering from any of these conditions would receive proper guidance regarding further treatment in our department.\n\nThe department also offers treatment for soft tissue sarcomas i.e. cancers arising in muscles near the bone. Appropriate surgical services are rendered and patients are guided on further treatment modalities like chemotherapy and radiation. Along with these, metastatic tumours are also dealt with. As with other conditions, not just surgical treatment is taken care of, the further multi-modal approach of treatment is offered.\n\n![Sunday OPD](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sunday-opd.jpg)\n\n×"

An orthoapaedic surgeon can visualize, diagnose, and treat problems within the joints, through the use of small instruments and cameras.\n\nThe joints are viewed by making one or more incisions around it. An instrument called Arthroscope is inserted into the joint by the surgeon. The Arthroscope allows the surgeon to view the joint on television, monitor and diagnose the problem, determine the extent of injury and make necessary repairs. It contains a fiber optic light source and a small television that helps the surgeon in doing that. To help view or repair the tissues inside the joint other instruments may also be used.\n\n#### What is the procedure for Rotator Cuff Surgery?\n\nShoulder surgery for Rotator Cuff problems generally involves one or more of the following procedures: Debridement, Subacromial Decompression, and Rotator Cuff Repair.\n\nDebridement clears the tissues which are damaged out of the shoulder joint. Subacromial decompression includes shaving bone or getting rid of spurs below the tip of the shoulder blade (acromion). This enhances the space between the end of the shoulder blade and the bone of the upper arm so that the rotator cuff tendon is not tweaked and can smoothly glide. If the Rotator Cuff Tendon is torn, it is stitched together and attached again to the top of the upper arm bone.\n\n#### What is a reverse shoulder replacement?\n\nIn a conventional shoulder replacement a metal ball is used on the top of the arm bone and a plastic socket is used on the shoulder blade. Our body is also designed in a similar fashion with a ball-and-socket shoulder joint.\n\nLikewise, the reverse shoulder replacement also uses a ball-and socket but in a reverse manner. Here the ball is put on the shoulder blade, and the socket is put above the arm bone. The name reverse shoulder replacement is thus used because it is a reverse method compared to our normal anatomy.\n\n![Sunday OPD](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sunday-opd.jpg)\n\n×"

What is the age group for these fractures?\n\nWrist fractures caused due to falls, also called Colles fractures are most common in women above the age of 60 years. They are also observed in people diagnosed with osteoporosis, or weak bones.\n\n### 3\\. What happens if medical treatment is not taken?\n\nWithout care, a Colles fracture cannot heal properly.

Despite any potential issues, appropriate action can result in positive outcomes.\n\n### 6\\. How long does a plaster have to be worn?\n\nYou might need to wear a plaster cast for six to eight weeks if you experience severe fractures. If the initial cast becomes too loose as the swelling subsides, you might require a second one. You could require the assistance of an orthopaedic surgeon if your fracture is severe.\n\n### 7\\. What is the procedure of a surgery?\n\nPercutaneous pinning, internal fixation, external fixation, and bone replacements are all surgical alternatives.

As a salient feature, the above number comprised of 84 Kyphoscoliotic deformity correction,72 spinal fractures, more than 350 microscopic lumbar discectomy and 42 revision spinal surgeries.\n\nOne of the soft corners of the spine team is their paraplegic rehabilitation. There have been heart-warming stories of patients walking after a successful surgical outcome. No surgical work is complete without efficient physiotherapy and rehabilitation. Sancheti Hospital’s spinal team is backed by physiotherapy department where patients get admitted for rehabilitation and further recovery.\n\nOne of the new concerns in the spine department is the rising number of Tuberculosis spine cases.

But to our surprise we see lots of young people presenting to the clinic these days. This changing trend we see is because of lifestyle modifications happening in our current generation\n\n1\\. Change in the food habits which encompass fast food and packed food culture. This saves few seconds but deprives our body of essential nutrients and exposes it to harmful preservatives which have carcinogenic potential.\n\n2\\. Lack of exercises, no sunlight exposure, whole day sitting job, bad postures etc. All this factors leads to.\n\n![spine](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/spine.png)\n\n## Spine Disorders are Divided Into\n\n#### PREVENTIVE\n\nTo prevent spine problems in young individuals by educating them by conducting lectures, workshops and symposium\n\n#### THERAPEUTIC\n\nTo treat patients who have already got spinal problems\n\n### Back Pain\n\nBack pain is the most common reason people self-treat and seek medical advice. It is studied to affect approximately three in four individuals during their lifetime. When we talk about back pain we mean pain that originates in the spine anywhere between the upper and lower back.\n\nTreatment for back pain varies from medicines, physiotherapy, spinal injections to surgery. Majority of the patients get benefitted with non operative treatment. Only a few of them require surgery.\n\nSancheti Hospital spine surgery department offers a wide range of treatment varying from state of art physio, ergonomics training, postural correction and modified yoga classes, pain management clinic to a complete surgical solutions in all areas of spine.\n\n#### Different types of back pain.\n\n#### Acute Back Pain\n\nIs severe but lasts short period of time.\n\n#### Chronic Back Pain\n\nUsually occurs daily. Can be severe occasionally, usually nature of pain is mild, dull aching, increases with activity and reduces with rest.\n\n#### Lumbar Radicular Pain\n\nBack or neck pain pain that travels into leg or arms respectively. It considered as radicular pain, especially when it is radiating below the knee and elbow. This suggests compression of a nerve which leads to condition called sciatica in leg and brachialgia in arms\n\nIt is common for back pain to be associated with symptoms, as tingling and numbness sensations, weakness, stiffness and occasionally involvement of bowel and bladder sensation which is known as cauda equina syndrome. It is an emergency in spine where the pinched nerve roots have to be freed immediately\n\n![Spine Surgery Department](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/two-section.jpg)\n\n![Spine Surgery Department](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/b1.jpg)\n\n### Common **Spinal Problems**\n\n– Back Pain\n\n– Neck Pain\n\n– Spondylolisthesis-One spinal bone is slipped over the other\n\n– Prolapsed intervertebral disc (commonly known as slipped disc)\n\n– Spinal fractures\n\n– Osteoporosis in spine (weak bones)\n\n– Spinal deformities- Scoliosis and Kyphosis- commonly known as crooked spine\n\n– Spinal Infections- Tuberculosis, puogenic, fungal etc.\n\n– Spinal Tumours- malignant and benign\n\n![Spine Surgery Department](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Spine-Back-pain-500x500.jpg)\n\n![Spine Surgery Department](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/spine-blue-bg-1.jpg)\n\n## Spine- Back and Neck Care **Sancheti Spine Center**\n\nThe Service – Spine center would serve back/neck or spine pain patients efficiently, provide a comprehensive required surgical or nonsurgical treatment options.\n\nMany people with back problems have found relief from the pain. Some patients are apprehensive towards surgery. Of all the spine patients very few would need a surgery and with current technological advances surgeries are performed with minimum risk and are delivering world class surgical outcomes\n\n## O-arm and S8 Stealth Navigation System\n\n##### For Spine & Orthopaedic Surgeries\n\nWith the inclusion of the O arm ® and S8 Stealth navigation systems the department of spine surgery offers safety, accuracy, and precision in all spine surgeries being performed.

        "markdown": "Whether you’re a gifted athlete who trains regularly or an office worker who spends his entire life hunched in front of a desk daily doesn’t matter. Everyone is vulnerable to an orthopaedic injury that could strike at any time. Many orthopaedic injuries occur because of an accident, and we can’t do much about them but get the orthopaedic urgent care they need. Nevertheless, while accidents certainly happen, we can prevent most orthopaedic injuries and succeed. Here are some tips and exercises that can help you prevent common orthopaedic injuries.\n\n**When suffering from common joint injuries, follow the RICE protocol:**\n\n**R:** One should take complete rest after an acute injury; the problem will alleviate with excessive movement of the joints.\n\n**I:** Apply ice packs to the area at least 3-4 times for 10 to 15 minutes around the joint area where it hurts; ice packs reduce the inflammation and help in healing.\n\n**C:** Apply compression with crepe bandage for knee injuries as it reduces the excessive swelling and supports the part.\n\n**E:** Elevate the injured body part, reducing the swelling as it increases venous blood flow away from the joint towards the central body.\n\nRICE protocol can be followed for bone and joint injuries like ankle, foot, wrist, elbow and fingers. We can apply any standard pain ointment or balm but avoid rigorously massaging the area as it leads to further injury and increased reactionary circulation leading to increased swelling\n\n**Here are some tips and exercises that can help you prevent common orthopaedic injuries.**\n\n- **Get regular exercise**\n\n\nRegular exercise provides many health benefits, preventing orthopaedic injuries included. As you regularly perform strength training and endurance exercises, your muscles and joints become potent and tougher, allowing you to handle the effects of high-impact activities better. Stronger muscles provide additional bone protection, which regular exercise can make denser\n- **Stretch your muscles**\n\n\nStretching is vital to working out, as it helps improve your body’s flexibility and aids blood flow to your muscles. Better blood flow to the muscles improves their nutrient absorption ability, and discarding lactic acid and other waste products becomes manageable. On top of helping you become more flexible, stretching exercises can also provide additional benefits, such as increasing your range of motion, improving your posture, and calming your mind\n- **Maintain a healthy weight**\n\n\nBeing overweight strains your weight-bearing joints, such as your knees, ankles, hips, and back. Every pound of excess weight you carry results in an additional four pounds of extra pressure on your weight-bearing joints. Your chance of developing joint damage can reduce by achieving and maintaining a healthy weight, which will lessen the strain on your joints. It would also be great to consume healthy amounts of dietary fats that help with nutrient absorption and hormone production, which are critical in protecting your muscles and joints from injury.\n- **Wear the right shoes**\n\n\nWhenever you stand, walk, jog, or run for specific stretches, you put a certain amount of strain on your legs’ structural makeup. Over time, the effects of that strain will accumulate and lead to various musculoskeletal issues. However, wearing footwear appropriate for the activity you’re engaging in should help reduce the pressure on your feet and legs. There’s a veritable treasure trove of shoes designed to cushion your joints and bones, from the most comfortable running footwear to basketball shoes that effectively absorb the impact of landing on the court.\n- **Go swimming**\n\n\nIf you want a workout that doesn’t strain your joints and bones too much, go swimming instead! Swimming is a low-impact activity that gives you excellent cardiovascular exercise without damaging orthopaedic health. When you go swimming, you get the opportunity to increase not just your flexibility but your range of motion as well, both of which reduce your risk of orthopaedic injury.\n- **How does Sancheti Hospital help you?**\n\n\nThrough minimal incisions, orthopaedic physicians at [Sancheti Hospital Pune](https://sanchetihospital.org/joint-replacement-department/) undertake joint replacement surgeries. This process is called minimally invasive surgery. It might result in less bleeding, a smaller scar, less pain, and a simpler recovery. Additionally, these procedures may need\n\n\nd specialised tools and materials, such as computer-generated tailored surgery resection guides, computer-assisted surgical intervention, and computer-assisted robotics. Sancheti Hospital has state-of-the-art machinery to ensure excellent and smooth joint replacement surgery, guided by the able hands of surgeons with years of expertise and knowledge.\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n##### **How can you help avoid injury to your bones and joints?**\n\nInjury-prevention tips are\n\n- Avoid doing too much, too soon.\n- Maintain strength in the muscles surrounding the joint area.\n- Train smart by cross-training\n- Never skip your warm-up or cool-down.\n- Always use proper technique and body mechanics when playing sports involving repetitive motion, such as tennis and golf.\n- Be in shape.\n\n##### **What is the best exercise to protect joints**\n\nThe best exercise to protect joints includes walking, bicycling, swimming and water aerobics. If working out for 10 minutes is easier on your joints, do that.\n\n##### **What are four ways to keep your joints healthy?**\n\nHere are four ways to keep your joints healthy:\n\n- Maintain a healthy weight\n- Keep moving\n- Use correct posture\n- Eat right.\n\n##### **How do you keep your bones, muscles and joints healthy?**\n\nExercise is a fantastic way to preserve your bone and joint health. Weight-bearing exercises– such as using hand weights, doing bodyweight exercises like push-ups or squats, or even walking at an incline–can help keep your bones healthy by increasing bone density.\n\n##### **What foods are good for your joints?**\n\nHere are a few foods that help reduce joint pain:\n\n- Omega-3 fatty acids/fish oils\n- Nuts and seeds\n- Brassica vegetables\n- Colourful fruits\n- Olive oil\n- Lentils and beans\n- Garlic and root vegetables\n- Whole grains\n\n#### Did you like this?

The dedicated **Joint (Knee & Hip) Replacement unit of Sancheti Hospital in India**, one of its kinds in the country, conducts _replacement surgeries for the knee, hip, shoulder, ankle, and elbow._ A specially designed complex of 4 operating theatres incorporating advanced processes, such as laminar airflows, a specialized coating of the walls of the theater which are seamless, and the special coating of the flooring which is antistatic and bacterial and fungal resistant;  provides a highly sterile environment essential to avoid post-surgery infections.\n\nAvailability of computer-assisted [**joint-replacement surgery**](https://sanchetihospital.org/joint-replacement-department/) has substantially increased the accuracy of the surgery. _Joint replacement surgery_ is a procedure in which the surgeon will remove the damaged cartilage and bone and then replace it with a new metal and plastic joint surface to restore the alignment and painless functioning of your joints.\n\n![knee-replacement](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/knee-replacement.jpg)\n\n## **Total Knee** Replacement Surgery\n\nIf non-surgical treatments are ineffective, [_total knee replacement surgery_](https://sanchetihospital.org/joint-replacement-department/) can be considered as a safe and effective procedure to relieve pain and help you resume normal activities. It also helps to correct the deformity. The results of knee replacement are predictable and long-lasting. Also because of the developments in anaesthesia, pain control and physiotherapy, one can resume back to normal routine activities fairly soon after the surgery.\n\n### **The Knee**\n\nThe Knee Joint is among the strongest, largest and most complex joints of the body. During leg movements, you depend on it for support and mobility. when the knee joint becomes painful, its mobility is reduced and performing daily activities of living becomes difficult.\n\n## The Indus Knee **India’s First Indigenous Implant**\n\nEarly in the course of his practice, Dr. K. H. Sancheti realized that imported joints, because of their high cost, were not affordable for the Indian patient. In addition Indian patients desired greater flexion of the knee. This led to the design of India’s first high flex design â€“ the Indus knee joint.\n\nIn August 2005, the INDUS knee was successfully implemented for the first time on a crippled arthritic patient, and a dream became reality.\n\n![Indus Knee](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/indus-knee.png)\n\n### Indus Knee Surgery **Advantages**\n\n**– Highly cost-effective implant**\n\n**– Specially designed to aid an increased range of motion**\n\n**– Suited to Indian lifestyles**\n\n**– Minimal removal of bone**\n\n# **FAQ**\n\n#### [How long would the artificial joint last?](\\#1531921052618-2647015d-a395)\n\nAn artificial joint can last for 15 plus or minus 5 years or even longer. However, the life span is affected by the weight of the person and by his activities. An overweight person or a person actively involved in sports can wear out the artificial joint quicker than a thin or a more sedentary person.\n\n#### [What is the average time taken for joint replacement surgery?](\\#1531921052662-8af8df31-904e)\n\nThe average time taken for the joint replacement surgery is one hour. However it takes about three hours for the patient to come out of O.T.\n\n#### [Can people with diabetes, high blood pressure or heart trouble undergo joint replacement surgery?](\\#1531980835339-33d7186d-9b72)\n\nA person with diabetes, hypertension or heart conditions can undergo joint replacement surgery. However, diabetes and blood pressure must be under control before surgery.\n\n#### [When will I be allowed to drive after my surgery?](\\#1531980883870-b6cc0ff2-4eef)\n\nYou can drive a four wheeler 4-8 weeks after surgery and only after consulting your surgeon.\n\n#### [Should I have a total knee replacement surgery?](\\#1531980913503-fbc2904a-b3cd)\n\nTotal knee replacement is an elective operation. The decision to have the operation is not made by the doctor, it is made by you. The doctor may recommend the operation, but your decision must be based on the problems faced by you versus the benefit you are going to get after surgery.\n\n#### [Does one require walker or stick support after joint replacement surgery?](\\#1531981013067-ba781986-98de)\n\nYes, one requires external support aids for 3-6 weeks after the operation. These walking aids are discarded in due course of time once muscle control improves.\n\n#### [How long does recovery and rehabilitation take?](\\#1531981072584-1d373d60-b8d3)\n\nGenerally patients have to spend maximum 3 to 5 days in the hospital after hip replacement surgery. Full recovery takes about 3 to 6 months; however, it depends on the type of surgery, your overall health, and your own participation in the success of your rehabilitation.\n\n#### [How long do I have to exercise?](\\#1531981104936-2df69562-be37)\n\nPlease remember that you make your joint move around. The target is to have a good strength in the patient to allow for desired walking and other activities. For this a scheduled and proactive exercise schedule should be followed.\n\n![Dr. Parag Sancheti](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Parag-Sancheti.jpg)\n\nDr. Parag SanchetiKnee Surgeon\n\n[View Profile](https://sanchetihospital.org/dr-parag-sancheti/)\n\n![DR.-SUNNY-GUGALE](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DR.-SUNNY-GUGALE-2.jpg)\n\nDr. Sunny GugaleKnee Surgeon\n\n[View Profile](https://sanchetihospital.org/dr-sunny-gugale/)\n\n![Sancheti Hospital](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kailash-Patil.jpg)\n\nDr. Kailas PatilKnee Surgeon\n\n[View Profile](https://sanchetihospital.org/dr-kailas-patil/)\n\n![Dr. Obaid Ul Nisar](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/WhatsApp-Image-2020-02-27-at-1.24.00-PM-1.jpeg)\n\nDr. Obaid Ul NisarKnee Surgeon\n\n[View Profile](https://sanchetihospital.org/dr-obaid-ul-nisar/)\n\n![Sunday OPD](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sunday-opd.jpg)\n\n×"

        "markdown": "![Rheumatology & Arthritis Clinic](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Rheumatology-Arthritis-Clinic.jpg)\n\n# Rheumatology & **Arthritis Clinic**\n\n[Make An Appointment](https://sanchetihospital.org/appointment/ \"\")\n\nAt Sancheti Hospital we have a world-class rheumatology clinic with para-clinical back up like Physiotherapy / Occupational Therapy Units and specialized laboratory etc. Most of the patients and even the doctors are not well-versed with this specialty of Rheumatology that deals with chronic inflammatory disorders. We have Rheumatologists that conduct rheumatology and arthritis clinic daily on weekdays.\n\nRheumatology is a study of disorders of connective tissues, joints, muscles and immune system. The word rheumatology is derived from the Greek word rhematismos, of which rheuma means ‘stream’, since arthritis was believed to have resulted from internal flow of humours (body fluids). Based on scrutiny of medical and nonmedical literature, it has been established that Rheumatic diseases like Ankylosing Spondylitis, Gout and Osteoarthritis have existed for several thousand years. Various relevant written sources, pictorial representations and paleopathological findings from Europe, America and Asia support the existence of chronic inflammatory polyarthritis since very early times. ‘Caraka Samhita’, a medical text from India written between 500 BC and 100 AD also included description of chronic polyarthritis. So we can say chronic inflammatory disorders have been there for many centuries though the incidence is now increasing.\n\n![Sancheti Hospital](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Arthritis-img.jpg)\n\nRheumatism means pain and inflammation of joints, muscles and ligaments and is a cardinal feature of Rheumatic diseases. A number of diseases like Rheumatoid Arthritis, Ankylosing spondylitis, Reactive arthritis, Psoriatic arthritis, Enteropathic arthritis, Infective arthritis, Gout; Collagen tissue disorders like SLE, Scleroderma, Sjogren’s syndrome, Poly myositis/ Dermatomyositis and various Vasculitis syndromes are few examples of Rheumatic diseases. These diseases, though not curable, can be controlled with good evidence based treatment.\n\nThe patients with these chronic inflammatory diseases have increased mortality and morbidity as compared to the general population as they are predisposed to Heart and Lung diseases, Stroke, Cancer and Infections. Early diagnosis and optimum treatment is important to prevent complications and deformities and also improve quality of life.\n\n# FAQ\n\n#### Is the condition curable?\n\nMost of the Rheumatic diseases are not curable. However, their activity can be controlled by optimum evidence based use of disease modifying and symptomatic drugs. Some conditions may have a self limiting course. Regular follow ups with assessment of disease and therapy is required.\n\n#### What are the side effects of drugs?\n\nThe side effects of the drugs can be mild, moderate or severe. Severe untoward effects like anaphylaxis (severe allergy) and idiosyncratic reactions are rare. Mild-to-moderate side effects like nausea and vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness, dyspepsia (acidity), mild skin rashes can be managed and usually do not require discontinuation of treatment. Regular follow-up visits and investigations help to minimize untoward effects.\n\n#### Are Homeopathy or Ayurvedic treatments effective?\n\nUse of alternative medicines may have interactions and unknown adverse effects. There is no scientific basis to prove if they are beneficial in these conditions.\n\n#### What if no treatment is taken for these diseases?\n\nPersistent inflammation and disease activity will result in structural damage and functional loss. Further, morbidity and increased mortality can occur due to increased possibility of Heart and Lung diseases, Stroke, Cancer and infections.\n\n![Sunday OPD](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sunday-opd.jpg)\n\n×"

It is very necessary to tell your anaesthetist your complete medical history, so that he can plan the ideal anaesthesia for your surgery.\n\n#### Q: What are the fasting guidelines?\n\nA: We suggest fasting from midnight (12 am) for the morning pre-operative cases. For other pre-operative cases, fasting 10 hours before the operation is recommended we also advise our patients to have light food and avoid heavy dinners.\n\n#### Q: What about post-operative fasting?\n\nA:One needs to fast for 4-6 hours after the surgery.\n\n#### Q: How is post-op pain managed?\n\nA: Pain relief is provided in the form of epidural analgesia, systemic opiods or NSAID or Nerve Block catheters.\n\n#### Q: What are the different types of anaesthesia?\n\nA: There are four types of anaesthesia viz. General Anaesthesia, Regional Anaesthesia, Epidural Anaesthesia and Spinal Anaesthesia.\n\n#### Q: What is spinal anaesthesia?\n\nA: Spinal anaesthesia is an injection of medication given in the lower part of the back, into the space surrounding the spinal cord. A very small special needle is used to inject the medication into the spinal fluid, so that it spreads out to numb the nerves of the lower half of the body. Contrary to popular belief, spinal anaesthesia does not hurt; in fact it is no more painful than having an injection.\n\n#### Q: What is Epidural anaesthesia?\n\nA: Epidural anaesthesia, commonly known as epidural, is used to numb the upper or lower half of the body. Anaesthetic medication is injected into the epidural space of the spine. Chest, abdomen, pelvic area and legs are some of the areas that can be numbed by an epidural. We routinely insert epidural catheters through which pain relief medications can be given for 48 hours with the help of elastomeric pumps.\n\n#### Q: Could I wake up during surgery?\n\nA: There are ways to monitor the signs through which we can assess how deeply under anaesthesia you are, so awareness under anaesthesia is extremely rare and every precaution will be taken to ensure that you will have no perception of the surgery.\n\n#### Q: Will spinal anaesthesia induce backache?\n\nA: Since very thin needle is used for spinal anaesthesia the patient rarely gets any backache because of this technique.\n\n#### Q: How will I recover from anaesthesia?\n\nA: Recovery from anaesthesia does not take long period of time. We use short acting and latest drugs. Hence to contrary belief, patients recover from anaesthesia rapidly. However allergic reaction to anaesthetic agent may happen despite all the precautions.\n\n![Sunday OPD](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sunday-opd.jpg)\n\n×"

        "markdown": "The 21st-century lifestyle has an overwhelming abundance of everything. And with so many things to cope with, stress takes over most of our conscience leaving us unhinged and anxious. Stress is our body’s natural defence against predators and danger. It prepares us to fight or flight and releases umpteen amounts of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine.\n\nA few symptoms of stress can range from physical, emotional and behavioral effects and hinder the productivity and the general well-being of a human being. Chronic stress can also lead to complications like anxiety disorder, depression, heart disease, blood pressure problems etc.\n\n**Stress Management Techniques:**\n\n1. **Exercise**: Whether full-fledged workout plans or finding opportunities to just move your body, exercise is a great stress-buster. It releases hormones like endorphins that block pain, improve sleep and sedate you. It gives your body a euphoric feeling and when your body feels good, your mind follows. Running, swimming, dancing, walking, cycling, and cleaning are a few relaxing exercises.\n2. **Diet**: The benefits of eating healthy foods have paramount impact on your mental health. By eating healthily, you can eliminate stress, boost your immune system, reduce blood pressure, and level your mood. While junk food, alcohol, cigarettes and caffeine can seem even more appealing when you’re under a lot of stress, lots of added sugar and fat can have the opposite effect. Antioxidants protect your cells from all the damage that stress causes. Complex carbohydrates, vitamin c, omega 3 fatty acids and magnesium are inherent stress busters.\n3. **Prioritisation**: Grinding at work and having an over-the-top to-do list may be a hustler’s identity. But sometimes, focusing on only high priority and time-sensitive tasks can bring more satisfaction than anything else. Bring your nerd out; organise your schedules, relax, and pursue your personal interests and hobbies. Prioritize yourself over anything that’s causing you much stress.\n4. **Techniques**:\n\n\na) The slow movements, stretching, and deep breathing of Yoga evaporate magnanimous amounts of stress.\n\n\nb) The 5000-year-old cure of **Meditation** or the quiet exercise of paying attention to your breathing, allowing thoughts to come and go and living in your body than in your mind cures almost everyone.\n\nc) **Deep breathing** calms your nervous system which controls your ability to relax.\n\nd) Learning how to manage your heart rate, muscle tension, and blood pressure when stress hits through **biofeedback** can also help you recognize the sources of stress and eliminate them.\n\ne) When you laugh, you take in more oxygen. Your heart, lungs, and muscles get a boost and your body releases those feel-good hormones.

        "markdown": "**Ankle or foot sprain** is common among those who often involve in intense workout sessions or don’t have steady balance while walking. If you find any ankle sprain symptoms like bruises or pain around the ankles, here’s what you need to know about how it can be treated.\n\n**What causes a sprained ankle?** Sprained ankle occurs when the muscle in your ankle, attached to the ligament, is stretched beyond its limit during a fall, twist or roll. This is a common and easily treatable condition with a short recovery period.\n\n**What are the indications of a foot and ankle sprain?** You may have a sprained ankle if you experience the following symptoms:\n\n- Swelling in the ankle joint\n- Bruising around the ankle, foot or toes\n- Discomfort while walking\n- Difficulty while bending the ankle up and down\n- Pain in the ankle region\n\n**How do I know if I sprained my ankle?** There are many ways through which you can detect an ankle sprain. When you hear a popping sound or sensation near your ankle, it might indicate a sprain. Also, you may lose balance due to an unstable ankle and experience sudden and terrible pain in that area. There can be a slight reduction in the range of motion, where you can take only a few short steps. This is how you know that your ankles are sprained.\n\n**How is a sprained ankle treated?** The affected ankle can be treated through the ‘PRICE’ method after 24-48 hours of the injury. It consists of the following:\n\n**Protection** Doctors will provide crutches, braces or splints to reduce the force applied to your ankles. You can take little steps not to hurt your ankles again.\n\n**Rest** To avoid further damage, all you need is at least one day’s rest to be up and running the next day or in a couple of days after the injury.\n\n**Application of ice**\n\nTake an ice pack and keep it on the injured ankle at regular intervals to reduce swelling.\n\n**Compressions** To decrease swelling, you can also wrap your ankle in an elastic bandage, so you don’t move the damaged part often, and worsen the condition.\n\n**Elevation** Raise your ankles on a pillow while sitting or sleeping so there is enough pressure to reduce the pain around your ankle.\n\n**How can Sancheti help you?**\n\n[Sancheti Hospital](https://sanchetihospital.org/joint-replacement-department/) has a great foot and ankle care centre that offers the latest medical technologies to give the best solutions for a sprained ankle and other foot troubles. To know more about our doctors, visit the website.\n\n**People also ask** **Can I walk on a sprained ankle?** Anyone can walk with a sprained ankle. However, it would help if you kept a few things in mind before walking with the affected ankle. You can apply ice before visiting the doctor, as it reduces swelling and pain. Once you receive medical attention, you can walk as per your physician’s advice.\n\n**Do I need surgery to treat my sprained ankle?** According to the severity of your ankle pain, it’s divided into three grades. Based on it, your doctor might advise you to opt for surgery. Grade three is the worst, as the damage can be significant, while grade one needs minimal treatment. Visit your physician immediately for a quick recovery.\n\n**How can I reduce the possibility of spraining my ankle?** Several factors can make your ankle weak, leading to a sprain. Here’s what you can do to reduce it:\n\n- You can use an ankle brace made of elastic that supports your ankle during jogging or working out\n- Involve in exercises to increase your balance and strengthen the ankles\n- Reduce weight, if your BMI is higher\n\n**How do I take care of myself after spraining my ankle?**\n\nAfter spraining your ankle once, it would help if you took great care of it to avoid another sprain. So, you can perform isometric, isotonic and coordination and agility exercises that heal your ankle quickly.\n\n#### Did you like this?

It aims to improve mobility, strength, balance, coordination, and functional abilities that may have been compromised due to conditions such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, cerebral palsy, and other neurological disorders.\n\nNeurorehabilitation physiotherapy involves a comprehensive assessment of the patient’s impairments, limitations, and goals, followed by the development of an individualized treatment plan. Treatment techniques may include:\n\n• Exercise therapy: Tailored exercises to improve muscle strength, flexibility, endurance, and coordination.\n\n• Gait training: Assistance in learning to walk again or improving walking patterns using devices such as parallel bars, walkers, canes, or orthotics.\n\n• Balance training: Exercises and activities aimed at improving balance and reducing the risk of falls.\n\n• Functional training: Practice of activities of daily living (ADLs) such as dressing, bathing, and cooking to enhance independence.\n\n• Manual therapy: Hands-on techniques including massage, joint mobilization, and stretching to improve range of motion and reduce pain.\n\n• Neuromuscular re-education: Training to help the brain relearn movement patterns and improve coordination.\n\nAssistive device training: Instruction in the use of assistive devices such as wheelchairs, braces, or prosthetics to optimize mobility.\n\nAdaptation strategies: Teaching compensatory techniques or modifications to overcome specific challenges related to neurological deficits.\n\nNeurorehabilitation physiotherapy is often delivered by physical therapists with specialized training in neurology and rehabilitation. The ultimate goal is to maximize functional independence, enhance quality of life, and promote participation in meaningful activities for individuals with neurological conditions. Treatment may be provided in various settings, including hospitals, rehabilitation centers, outpatient clinics, and home-based care. Additionally, interdisciplinary collaboration with other healthcare professionals such as occupational therapists, speech therapists, and physicians is common to address the multifaceted needs of neurorehabilitation patients.\n\n#### Did you like this?

        "markdown": "Many people experience anxiety before having surgery. Anxiety before surgery is described as unpleasant stress, uneasiness, or tension resulting from patients’ fears and doubts. Surgeries can be life-saving, but many fear going under the knife. In the process, you must ensure that the anxiety and stress don’t overwhelm you.\n\nThis feeling of anxiousness before surgery is also known as pre-operative or preoperational anxiety. Some common reasons for experiencing this feeling of uneasiness are-\n\n- Apprehension that the surgery may not be successful.\n- Having to recover in a completely new, and unknown surrounding in the hospital.\n- Anxiety about not being able to bear the pain.\n- Fear of not being able to fully recover.\n\nPeople might become over-sensitive to the surgery, and the experience can be far less pleasant and even increase future anxiety. Research has shown that high levels of stress have been linked to a higher risk of postoperative discomfort, extended hospital stays, and a need for painkillers. Thankfully, many different practices can help you stay calm before a surgery.\n\n**Have trust and faith in the fraternity**\n\nTrusting the medical professionals involved in the procedure is essential to lessen your fear and anxiety. Concern and trust are opposites. You will naturally feel in control again, and your mind will be at ease if you can trust the medical specialists treating you. The secret is good communication. You can only trust your doctors if you check their credentials, confer with them before surgery, and accept that they are the greatest at what they do.\n\n**Educate yourself well**\n\nOnce you know your medical condition, you should research it properly and know everything. It will help you overcome the fear of the surgery, the hospital, and the illness itself. At the same time, awareness can also be a cause of anxiety. An incorrect Google search can do a lot more harm. So, make sure you only trust credible sources.\n\n**Stop smoking**\n\nIf you smoke, you might need to do so to relax, and this is because stress causes the body to seek smoking. Smoking will indeed soothe your anxiety, but only temporarily. Smokers have a concern because it dramatically raises the possibility of difficulties during post-surgery recovery.\n\nAdditionally, it significantly slows down the healing of your wounds and raises the risk of infection. If you smoke and you know you will need surgery, ask to be considered for nicotine replacement treatment so you can give up smoking before the procedure and lower your risk of complications.\n\n**Seek support from family and friends**\n\nSupport comes in various forms, some of which may surprise you. Family and friends might be your most significant resource when conquering anxiety before surgery. Inquire about their amusing surgical tales and remind yourself that they’ve been there and had great results.\n\n**Alternative therapies for anxiety**\n\nTherapy is not the only treatment available for those anxious before surgery, even though surgery may be the only option for some diseases. Yoga, hypnosis, massage, mindful meditation, and many other excellent alternative health practices show promise in treating surgical-related anxiety. Remember, stress is temporary. The surgery you have scheduled is to help you feel better than before. View your surgery as unlocking a positive future with a better quality of life.\n\n**How does Sancheti Hospital Help you?**\n\nSancheti Hospital is an experienced orthopaedic in Pune, India. Operating for many years, the hospital specialises in orthopaedic traumas and dislocation. Sancheti is also one of the finest rehab centres in Pune.\n\n#### Did you like this?

Diabetes, with its acute complications, has become a major health mycardiosupply.com . World Health Organisation (WHO) projections show that at present 67 million Indians have diabetes, but half of them are not aware of it. This number is expected to swell to 100 million by the year 2030.\n\nConsidering the enormous burden of diabetes in India coupled with unawareness of this deadly disease; it is important to realize the cost effective measures of diabetes care such as\n\n• Early screening of diabetes and its complications\n\n• Monitoring of risk factors\n\n• Timely assessment of end organ damage\n\nThe’ ACE’ diabetes care program aims to cater to these unmet needs in Diabetes care\n\n![Diabetes Clinic](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DIABETES-img-01.jpg)\n\n# What is **ACE Diabetes Care**\n\n**A** Assessment \\| **C** Control \\| **E** Education of Diabetes\n\n### **Facilities at ACE Diabetes**\n\n**Sancheti Hospital has started ACE with a twofold purpose:**\n\n- To provide comprehensive and Total Diabetic Care i.e. not only routine treatment of diabetes but also of its various complications.\n- To provide this modern and efficient diabetes service right in the heart of Pune so that the facilities could be made available to a larger section of the population.\n\n![Diabetes Clinic](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DIABETES-img-02.jpg)\n\n### **What is Diabetes?**\n\nDiabetes mellitus is a metabolic cum vascular disorder in which the body’s capacity to utilise glucose, fat and protein is disturbed due to insulin deficiency and/or insulin resistance.\n\nThis could lead to damage of blood vessels if left uncontrolled. In people with diabetes there is insufficient insulin activity in the body.\n\nInsulin is a hormone produced by beta cells of islets of Langerhans in the pancreas.\n\n### **Action of insulin on the food**\n\nMost of the food we eat is broken down into glucose and other simple sugars.\n\nGlucose gets absorbed into the blood stream which enters into the cells and is used for energy.\n\nAs the blood glucose rises, insulin is released from the pancreas. Cells have receptor sites on the outside.\n\nWhen insulin attaches to the receptor sites, a passage is made and glucose enters into the cell.\n\nThus insulin regulates the blood glucose level.\n\nWhen there is an insulin deficiency, glucose cannot enter into the cells and remains in the blood which leads to high blood sugar levels.\n\n#### Normal Plasma Glucose Levels\n\n- Fasting 70 – 100 mg/dl\n- Post Prandial 100 – 140 mg/dl\n\n#### Insulin deficiency may be relative or absolute and may be due to\n\n- Insufficient production of insulin by the pancreas.\n- Sufficient production of insulin but non release into the blood stream.\n- Increased demand for insulin by the body tissues.\n- Destruction / Inactivation of insulin by enzymes and other factors produced by the liver and endocrine glands such as pituitary gland, adrenal cortex, thyroid etc.\n\n#### Symptoms of Diabetes\n\n- Increased thirst.\n- Increased hunger.\n- Excessive urination.\n- Weight loss.\n- Weakness and tiredness.\n- Delayed wound healing.\n- Numbness in hands and feet.\n- Blurred vision.\n- Itching in genitals.\n\n#### Risk factors for diabetes\n\n- Family history of diabetes.\n- Over weight / Obesity.\n- High blood pressure or hyperlipidemia.\n- Those with previous bad obstetric history.\n  - Recurrent abortions\n  - Still births\n  - Congenital malformations\n  - Big baby (over 3.5 kg at birth)\n- Mental stress\n- Physically inactive people (sedentary job)\n\n![Sunday OPD](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sunday-opd.jpg)\n\n×"

Patients, regardless of age, are seeking help or are referred for physiotherapy because physiotherapists are trained professionals to treat the physical impairments that are caused due to injury, trauma, disease or congenital health conditions. [Physiotherapy](https://sanchetihospital.org/physiotherapy-rehabilitation/) is also for individuals who have no functional or structural impairments but wish to improve their quality of life.\n\nOne of the fundamentals of physiotherapy is an individualized assessment and a carefully planned treatment regime for the subjective needs of the patient. This helps the physiotherapist to achieve the ultimate goal of the treatment regime. To bring the patient to an optimum, pain-free level of movement to perform mild to severe levels of physical activities.\n\n## Physiotherapy: Impact on Physical Function\n\nAn exercise program is planned that is aimed to provide a meaningful functional outcome. Out of the plethora of interventions used by the physical therapists in the continuation of bringing the patient back to pain-free movement, therapeutic exercises hold a strong grip to improve/ restore the patient’s function.\n\nTherapeutic exercise is systemic, in control planned physical movements to help the patient with the intend to;\n\n- Prevent worsening of the impairments of body structures and function.\n- Remediate various congenital disorders.\n- Improve or restore various body functions and enhance activity participation.\n- Prevent or help to reduce health-related risks.\n- Optimize the overall fitness and sense of well-being.\n\n## Types of Physiotherapy Interventions\n\n[Physiotherapy](https://sanchetihospital.org/physiotherapy-rehabilitation/) personifies a wide range of movement techniques. The individualized plan is based on the underlying risk and the clinical reasoning of the impairment in the body. It also focuses on the level of activity and participation of the individual. The types of exercise interventions specific to therapeutic exercises are:\n\n- Muscle performance exercises, which includes muscle strength, power and endurance training.\n- Stretching and Flexibility training, which includes muscle lengthening techniques and joint manipulation/mobilization techniques.\n- Neuromuscular facilitation, inhibition and control.\n- Aerobic conditioning and reconditioning.\n- Postural control, body ergonomics and stabilization exercises.\n- Balance and agility training.\n- Breathing exercises and Ventilator Support Training.\n- Task-specific functional training.\n\n## How safe is Physiotherapy?\n\nRegardless of the type of physical therapy intervention, the patient’s safety, of course, is paramount. Patient safety is the fundamental objective whether the exercise is performed under a therapist’s supervision or independently by the patient.\n\nA patient’s detailed health history (past and present medical and surgical history) is documented. Special attention is given to the patients who are unaccustomed to exertion due to physical exertion. Risk factors from exercises are carefully identified and weighed before a treatment session is initiated. Medical clearance from the patient’s surgeon/ physician is also considered before initiating an exercise program.\n\nSpecifics to each intervention, the environment, the clinical setting and the equipment are tested beforehand. The accuracy and the safety of the movement patterns are supervised with appropriate speed, intensity and frequency. All in all, the physiotherapist incorporates the principles of joint protection techniques to minimize the risk of injury and provide maximum safety to the patient.\n\n## Who can take Physiotherapy?\n\nYou can take Physiotherapy if you are someone who,\n\n- Wishes to improve the functioning of the activities that are most important to you at the home, office, school, or during your leisure time.\n- Needs help to perform activities independently.\n- Wishes to perform the activities of daily living with pain-free movements.\n- Of all the activities you are finding difficult to perform, the activities you wish to do better and learn better.\n- Admitted to Inpatient and Outpatient setup.\n- Admitted to Intensive Critical Care.\n- Met with an accident/ after the surgery.\n- Improve the quality of life.\n- Healthy aging.\n\nA physiotherapist understands how an exercise regime affects the tissues and the body systems and how the exercise-induced effects have an impact on improving the body structures and function.  The ultimate goal of physiotherapy is the achievement of a pain-free and symptom-free movement. Many health conditions suggestive of surgery are improved with the help of Physiotherapy. Physiotherapy not only plays an important role in post-operative treatment but also in many pre-operative cases. All in all, Physiotherapy is a boon to medical science and should be practised for the betterment of patients’ health.\n\n#### Did you like this?

For individuals above the age of 65, falling can lead to hospitalization, an increase in mortality rate, morbidity and spikes in the rate of nursing home placements.\n\nThe elderly are usually susceptible to falls because of accidents or environment-related reasons. However, there are multiple risk factors that precipitate the elderly to fall. They might be muscle weakness, arthritis, prescription medications that induce dizziness as their side effects, impairment in cognition or vision, postural hypotension (a state where your blood pressure drops due to an elongated period of lying or sitting), confusion, heart disease, diabetes, thyroid, nerves or blood vessels, improper footwear or simply an age older than 80.\n\nStudies show that about 20-30% of senior citizens falling suffer through hip fractures, broken bones or head trauma. The recovery process leaves them with no independence and a complicatedly poor quality of life. Their mobility gets restricted and leads to functional decline. The fear of being placed in a nursing home leads to anxiety, depression, helplessness and feeling of isolation.\n\nPrevention is better than cure. Following are a few precautions for fall prevention amongst the elderly:\n\n- **Exercise programs** improve muscle strength and make you stronger. It keeps your joints, tendons and ligaments flexible and slow exercises like walking or climbing stairs can also help reduce bone loss.\n\n- **Sleeping** adequately reduces dizziness and your chances of falling down.\n\n- **Blood Pressure** plays a key role in maintaining balance. When you stand up slowly your blood pressure doesn’t instantly drop and prevents you from feeling wobbly. It’s recommended to get your blood pressure checked while standing or lying down.\n\n- **Clear the clutter!** The majority of cases of falls are because of environmental barriers. Make sure you walk slowly on wet or icy surfaces. If you have a history of falls due to the same environment, it’s time to rearrange the space and make it fall-proof.\n\n- **Strengthening your bones** can go a long way to reducing hospital visits for fall-related fractures. Having healthy bones won’t reduce the chances of falling but it curtails the aftermath of dealing with a broken hip bone.\n\n- **Good footwear** like lace-up shoes with non-skid soles and low heels can increase grip on slippery or smooth surfaces and support your feet enough to prevent falling.\n\n1. Install bars and handrails are crucial for going up and downstairs, getting on and off the toilet, without injuring yourself.\n\nA sudden fall can be startling. Make sure you stay on the floor for a few moments to subside the impact of the fall and relax your breathing. Getting up too quickly can upset the injury. Thus, make sure you crawl and get up slowly towards a sturdy chair. Call for help from either people around you or dial an ambulance. You must inform your doctor about your fall history even at times you weren’t particularly hurt. It can alert the doctor about any secondary complications that might cause falls. The doctor might also recommend assistive devices like canes or walkers, or even a special bracelet to call for help when you fall. You must consult a physical therapist for the same.\n\n#### Did you like this?

        "markdown": "This article can be your starting point if you are planning to undergo orthopaedic surgery. Read on to know how Sancheti has the **best spine specialists and hand surgery team** in India to treat and care for you.\n\n**What to expect during recovery?**\n\n**Rehabilitation**\n\nAll surgeons will recommend rehabilitation for patients who underwent any orthopaedic surgery. This improves the range of motion, function, and greater strength and mobility, reducing pain and **quickening your recovery**. Most rehabilitation programs are tailored to relieve pain in specific areas after surgery. Once you discuss your expectations post-operation, your doctor will suggest the best process for recovery.\n\n**Occupational therapy**\n\nWhat follows your orthopedic surgery is physical/occupational therapy. Your surgeon might suggest informal therapy routines, like walking or moving the affected parts to reduce friction. Based on the severity, you need to sign up for physical therapy, spanning from a week and extending to a month. Physical or occupational therapy focuses on training the muscles and nerves to work together, restore balance and strength, learn to use canes and other helping devices and help you perform daily tasks like dressing, bathing and eating\n\n**Recovery**\n\nThe recovery period for each person differs. Your patience, tolerance level, and regular follow-up with your surgeon will aid in a quick recovery. It’s normal to feel the pain, even after one month of surgery. Hence, follow your surgeon’s instructions to T to get back to your routine as soon as possible.\n\n**How to optimise your healing?**\n\nOptimising your healing is as important as preparing before orthopaedic surgery. The following measures can be helpful.\n\n**Lift your affected part higher**\n\nIncreasing blood circulation from the operated area to your heart is essential. Hence, learn to lift maximum, which also reduces pain and swelling.\n\n**Move other parts for reduced swelling**\n\nThough your operation targets only one part or area, the entire unit can get sore after surgery. If you have had an elbow operation, you must start moving your arms slowly, per your physical therapist’s recommendation. This makes the other surrounding parts active and reduces pain too.\n\n**Move your joints**\n\nIf you had joint surgery, with your surgeon’s permission, you could perform exercises to activate the other joints. Rotate, move or bend to prevent your joints from becoming stiff. With time, you can rotate your surgical joint with others’ help.\n\n**Use necessary device**\n\nIn the knee, ankle, shanks or foot surgeries, you may first need a cane or other walking devices to help you manage weight while walking. Broken bones need strength to bear weight and balance, so a walking cane is used. Using these devices would help until you can manage walking alone.\n\nApart from this, what you eat, and drink can help your recovery quickly. Many don’t feel like eating post-surgery, as patients feel nauseated. You can ask your doctor what to include so that you feel hydrated and energetic. Remember that food is fuel to make your body work after an operation.\n\n**How can Sancheti help you**\n\n[Sancheti](https://sanchetihospital.org/) has the best team of orthopaedic surgeons in the country who follow the latest and minimally invasive techniques to treat our patients. Sancheti also has a fully functional rehabilitation centre, which promises a speedy recovery. Visit our website to learn more about our doctors and success stories.\n\n#### People also ask\n\n##### How can I maximise my healing after surgery?\n\nFeel confident that you can get better after surgery. Hydrate and eat a nutritious meal, follow instructions and allow your body to heal. All these will maximise healing.\n\n##### What is the most complex orthopaedic surgery to recover from?\n\nKnee and shoulder replacement, spinal fusion and reconstruction are the most complex orthopedic surgeries, as these cause more pain and have more extended recovery periods. With Sancheti, you can get the best solutions for all your orthopedic issues.\n\n##### How long is the healing process for orthopaedic surgery?\n\nFour weeks is the minimum healing period for orthopedic surgery, and it can also take two to three months, based on the type of surgery and severity of the issue. With occupational and physical therapy, all patients can get back to shape within a short time.\n\n##### How do you recover from orthopaedic surgery?\n\nPhysical therapy can improve your recovery after surgery, depending on your diet, health and other conditions. Simply put, trust your surgeon and follow his advice to return to your feet!\n\n#### Did you like this?

Seizures are the defining characteristic of epilepsy. These can manifest in different ways:\n\n- Generalized seizures: These seizures affect the entire brain and can cause loss of consciousness, convulsions, and muscle stiffness.\n- Focal seizures: Seizures that originate in a specific area of the brain can cause altered consciousness, unusual movements, or sensations that are limited to one body part.\n\n1. Auras are symptoms or warning signals that some people with epilepsy experience before having a seizure. Auras can manifest in a variety of ways, including odd tastes, scents, or visual distortions like déjà vu.\n\n1. Brief Bewilderment: People may go through a phase of confusion or disorientation following a seizure. The duration of this postictal state varies from a few minutes to multiple hours.\n\n1. A transient loss of consciousness may result from some seizures, especially absence seizures. People may appear “absent” or gaze blankly into space during these instances.\n\n1. Unplanned Motions: Extremity jerking or shaking are common uncontrollable motions associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. It’s crucial to remember that convulsions are not always the result of seizures.\n\n- People who are having focal seizures may go into staring spells where they are unresponsive and may move repetitively.\n\n1. Automata:\n\n- Automatisms are automatic, repetitive behaviors brought on by seizures. Lip-smacking, chewing, and other meaningless motions are examples of these.\n\n1. Symptoms in the body:\n\n- Many physical symptoms, including tingling in the extremities, numbness, and muscle weakness, can be present during a seizure.\n\n1. A shift in emotions:\n\n- The presentation of epilepsy can be complicated by mood swings or emotional shifts that might happen before, during, or following a seizure.\n\n**Diagnosis :**\n\n-  It’s really important to visit a doctor if you think you have epilepsy. They can figure out what’s going on and how to help you.\n-  Doctors might do tests like an EEG (brain wave test) or an MRI (a type of body scan) to understand more about what’s happening in your brain.\n\n**Treatment :**\n\n-   Doctors might give you special drugs called antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to help control your seizures.\n-   Healthy choices: Making good choices like getting enough sleep, managing stress, and staying away from things that trigger your seizures can also make a big difference.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nEpilepsy, while a complex condition, is manageable with the right medical care and support. By fostering awareness and dispelling myths, we can contribute to creating a more understanding and inclusive society for individuals living with epilepsy. If you or someone you know is affected by epilepsy, seek professional medical advice to ensure accurate diagnosis and optimal management.\n\n#### Did you like this?

From a larger perspective, it is a costly disease in terms of the health-care system and time lost from work.\n\nEarly detection and therapy is the mainstay for trying to prevent these complications.\n\nBMD testing results correlate well with the risk of fracture and the testing is easily performed in a time-efficient manner without any discomfort. Although many methods of BMD testing exist, the best currently is DEXA scanning. It is imperative that testing ultimately be done using state-of-the-art equipment with capable highly-trained personnel and a doctor well versed in interpreting the results.\n\n![Dual-Energy-X-ray](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Dual-Energy-X-ray.jpg)\n\n## Quick Facts about Bone Density Scan\n\n• 40% of postmenopausal women in the India have Osteopenia (low bone density). An additional 7% have osteoporosis.\n\n• BMD analysis is recommended for women between ages 50 and 65 with risk factors for osteoporosis and for all women over the age of 65. In addition,\n\nmen and women taking certain medications or having certain diseases should discuss testing with their doctor.\n\n• It tests your bone strength (calcium in the bones) & detects the overall risk of fractures in future.\n\n• By measuring BMD, it is possible to predict fracture risk in the same manner that measuring blood pressure can help predict the risk of stroke.\n\n• DEXA is quick, painless and the preferred method to measure BMD.  It takes 5 minutes and is completely noninvasive.\n\n![Sunday OPD](https://sanchetihospital.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/sunday-opd.jpg)\n\n×"

No doubt diabetic patient should walk regularly but along with it, he should know what foot care needs to be taken to avoid complications resulting from Diabetes or Diabetic neuropathy.\n\nIndia has become the capital of Diabetes in the world. We have the largest number of diabetic people. Diabetes is a disease which can be controlled but there is no cure. Hence when it is long-standing it is associated with some of the systemic complications like- Kidney affection- nephropathy, Eye affection- retinopathy. Similarly when it affects the nerves- its called as Neuropathy and usually, it affects feet- although it may affect other body parts also.\n\n**What is Diabetic Neuropathy?**\n\nDue to long-standing Diabetes nerves may get affected impairing their function like sensations or movements. Usually, its sensory components which will affect the sensations like superficial touch, temperature, joint position sense. It can affect any body part but feet are affected more often.\n\n**What are its ill effects**\n\n– Ulcer- wounds\n\n– Deformity- Charcot’s joints\n\n– Infections\n\n– Skin and nail problems\n\n1. **Ulcers / Wounds**\n\nDiminished superficial touch, temp, or pain will result in unnoticed injuries. Patients notice these injuries very late when others see their wounds or themselves when wounds are seen or palpated accidental.\n\n**_These wounds take lot of time for Diabetics to heal because of_**\n\n– Increased sugar levels- predisposing to infection\n\n– Maybe decreased blood supply\n\n– Loss of protective sensations\n\n– Due to which patient keeps on loading the injured part abnormally preventing the healing. Person with normal sensations when gets a wound\n\n– Due to the pain he reports early to the doctor, does not bear weight on it and takes the treatment on time so that the wound heals rapidly.\n\n2. **Charcot Joints-**\n\nA diabetic person with neuropathy gets the destruction of joints without much pain. These joints are called as Charcot’s joints.They need to be protected in shoes or braces throughout life. In some cases, the deformities may need to be corrected with surgery to avoid ulcer formation. But even if they are operated lifelong support and care is needed.\n\n3. **Infections**\n\nWounds in Diabetics may get infected. There may be soft tissue infections or bony infections. Infections may remain local or may spread to become life-threatening systemic infections. Local infections can be treated with debridements- i.e cleaning of wounds and antibiotics Itraconazole Without Prescription life-threatening infections few times amputation of the toe, foot or leg may be required.\n\n4. **Skin and nail problems**\n\n**Corns-**\n\nPatient with neuropathy has fewer sensations than normal. The common misconception in general population is corn results secondary to thorn rock or foreign body injury. But in Diabetics its Pressure callosity- means resulting from Pressure. Basically, the superficial touch, Temperature or joint position sensations are protective for the individual. Due to impaired joint position sense, the person starts loading the joint abnormally. The parts of the sole which are not supposed to bear weight if they are loaded- then it results in corns. They need not be excised with surgery as they will recur. Special footwear or special insoles are needed to redistribute the weight.\n\n**Cracks / fissures –** Diabetic neuropathy causes fewer secretions in the skin increasing the dryness of skin. Hence there is a tendency to form fissures or cracks on the sole. These cracks, later on, may become infected. It can be avoided by using moisturizer or Vaseline in the cracks before going to bed.\n\n**Nail bed infections –**\n\nThere may be repeated nail bed infections which need to be taken care by cutting the nails properly. Avoid cutting the nails too short as it may result in ingrowing\n\ntoenails.\n\n**Who will suffer from neuropathy?**\n\nNot every diabetic patient will suffer from diabetic neuropathy. Usually, long-standing diabetics have diabetic neuropathy. Neuropathy is independent of the sugar control.\n\n**What is the treatment of neuropathy?**\n\nActually, there is no cure for neuropathy. Once neuropathy is developed every care should be taken to prevent the complications of neuropathy. The aim of treatment is to keep the foot ulcer free and plantigrade.\n\n**Pressure + Neuropathy = Wound**\n\nNeuropathy cannot be treated.\n\nHence to treat the wound we need to take away the pressure. In a normal person due to the pain he himself takes away the pressure by not waling on the wound, but in a neuropathy, person patient keeps walking on the wound. This repetitive trauma makes it difficult for the wound healing. Special shoes or insoles in the shoes are needed for the offloading.\n\n# Management of Neuropathy Prevention is better than Cure.\n\nWe need to understand the foot care in people who have Diabetic neuropathy. It is also helpful for people who are prone to develop neuropathy.\n\n– Maintain good control of blood sugar\n\n– Walk regularly, but never walk Barefoot\n\n– Wear cotton socks\n\n– Take care to dry the feet completely after washing with water.\n\n– Wet areas between toes will cause maceration and also fungal infection.\n\n– One should always examine his feet with his hands as hands have better sensation than feet\n\n– One may use the mirror with the handle to see the bottom part of the foot which is not easily seen in elderly patients.\n\n– Family members should check feet of diabetic patients every weekend and periodic follow up with doctors will help to detect some early changes.\n\n– What is to be seen on Daily, Weekly or monthly check?\n\n– one should see if there are hard callosities, callosities or fissures.\n\n– To avoid dryness or fissures while going to bed one may use moisturizer or Vaseline.\n\n– To check the footwear regularly, as a damaged footwear may also be a cause for a wound.\n\n– Pl buy a footwear of correct size ( Best to buy in the evening as feet are swollen in the evening)\n\n– Avoid footwear with narrow toe box.\n\n– If you note any corn or callosity please do not excise or remove on your own as many time it is not necessary to remove it.\n\n– Custom made insoles will redistribute the load and they will heal on its own.\n\n– Many times some interventions at home in nonsterile conditions may result in infections.\n\n– Stop smoking. Diabetes and smoking is the worst combination for the feet.\n\n**What are Complications of Diabetic Neuropathy?**\n\n– Non-healing wounds- chronic non-healing ulcers over few months or years\n\n– Osteomyelitis- infection of the underlying bone\n\n– Amputation – removal of a toe and some part of a foot or leg may be necessary to salvage the limb or sometimes life also.\n\nHence, Regular checks, Proper footwear and awareness about the complications\n\nof diabetic neuropathy are keys to success in prevention and treatment of\n\nDiabetic Neuropathy.\n\n![Foot and Ankle

संतुलित आणि पथ्थ्यांसह आहार घेण्याचा सल्ला दिला जातो त्यावेळी त्याला चालण्याचा व्यायाम करण्यावर भर देण्याची सूचना देखील केली जाते. मधुमेहाच्या रुग्णाने चालणे हे आवश्यक आहे यात शंका नाही. पण त्याशिवाय मधुमेहासह मधुमेहामुळे मज्जासंस्थेच्या आजारांमुळे पायांची कोणतीही दुखापत होणार नाही किंवा गुंतागुंत होणार नाही यासाठी पायाची कशी काळजी घ्यावी अथवा पायाचे आजार उद्भवणार नाही यासाठी काय टाळावेत हेही सांगितले जाते.\n\nजगाची मधुमेहीची राजधानी म्हणून आता भारत पुढे येत आहे. भारतात जगाच्या तुलनेत सर्वाधिक मधुमेही रुग्णांची संख्या आढळून येत आहे. मधुमेहाचा आजार हा नियंत्रित करता येणे शक्य पण तो कायमस्वरुपी बरा करता येत नाही. मधुमेहाचा आजार हा मृत्यूपर्यंत त्या व्यक्तीच्या सोबतीला राहतो. म्हणजेच आजारामुळे त्या रुग्णाला मूत्रपिंडांचा संसर्ग, मज्जासंस्थेचा आजार, डोळ्यांचा संसर्ग होऊन नेत्रपटलांचा रोग यासारखे आजार उदभवतात. शरिरातील नसांवर आजाराचा परिणाम झाल्यास त्याला न्यूरोपॅथी अर्थात मज्जासंस्थांचा रोग असे म्हटले जाते. त्याचा परिणाम अर्थात पायांवर होतो. कारण हा पाय हे देखील आपल्या शरिराचा एक भाग आहे.\n\n#### **मधुमेही मज्जासंस्थांचा रोग म्हणजे काय** **?**\n\nदीर्घकाळापर्यंत मधुमेहाचा आजार जडला असल्यास त्याचा परिणाम शरिरातील शिरांवर (नसा) होतो. परिणामी, संवेदना, हालचालीच हरवून बसण्याचा धोका असतो. प्रामुख्याने शरिरातील शिरा या संवेदनासंदर्भातील महत्त्वाचा घटक मानलजा जातो. त्यामुळे स्पर्श, हालचाल, तापमान यांसदर्भात माहिती देण्यावर परिणाम होऊ शकतो. शरिराच्या कोणत्याही भागावर मधुमेहाचा परिणाम जेवढा होतो त्याच्या तुलनेत पायांवर होणारा परिणाम हा गंभीर ठरतो. तो सर्वाधिक नुकसानकारक मानला जातो.\n\n#### **आजाराचे कोणते परिणाम होतात** **?**\n\n- जखमा होणे\n- अपंगत्व\n- त्वचेचे आणि नखांच्या समस्या\n- संसर्ग\n\n**जखमा होणे**\n\nतात्पुरता वरवरचा कमी प्रमाणातील स्पर्श, वेदनामुळे कधीही न दिसणारी जखम दिसून येते. अशा रुग्णांना स्वतःच्या जखमा खूप उशिरा कळतात किंवा इतरांच्या नजरेस त्या आल्या की त्यामुळे स्वतःला दिसून येतात. अचानक अशा जखमा दिसून आल्याने कधी कधी धडकी भरल्यासारखे होते.\n\nमधुमेहींमध्ये अशा पायाच्या जखमा पूर्णपणे बरे होण्यास खूप कालावधी लागतो. कारण…\n\n- साखरेचे शरिरातील वाढत्या प्रमाणामुळे संसर्ग वाढण्यास अनुकूल होते.\n- रक्तपुरवठा कमी होऊ शकतो\n- संरक्षणात्मक संवेदना नष्ट होतात – जखमा झालेला भाग रुग्णाने जखम वाढण्यापासून संरक्षित केला अथवा त्याला धक्का लागण्यापासून दूर ठेवले तर लवकर बरी होऊ शकते. साधारण व्यक्तीला जखमा झाल्या की त्याच्या संवेदना जाणवतात. वेदना होताच त्या व्यक्तीने डॉक्टरांना दाखवून वेळोवेळी उपचार घेतल्यास अथवा त्यावर भार न दिल्यास त्या वेगाने बऱ्या होऊ शकतात.\n\n**–          चारकोट सांधे** **Charcot Joints**\n\nमधुमेही व्यक्तीला मज्जारज्जा संस्थेच्या रोगामुळे सांधे खऱाब होतात. त्यामुळे वेदना देखील होतात. अशा व्यक्ती वेदनामुळे अपंगत्व आल्यासारखे चालतात. अशाच सांध्यांना चारकोट सांधे असे वैज्ञानिक भाषेत म्हटले जाते. असे सांधे सुजल्यासारखे अथवा अपंगत्व आल्यासारखे दिसते. अशा सांध्यांना बूट अथवा कापडी पट्टा लावून आयुष्यभर राहणे आवश्यक राहण्याशिवाय पर्याय नसतो.\n\n–          **संसर्ग**\n\nमधुमेहींना जखमा झाल्या तर त्याचा संसर्ग होण्याची शक्यता अधिक असते. त्यांना त्वचेचा संसर्ग अथवा हाडांचा संसर्ग होण्याची शक्यता असते. संसर्ग झाल्यानंतर ती जखम त्याच ठिकाण राहत अथवा त्या जखमेच्या संसर्गामुळे तिचा विस्तार वाढत जाऊन आयुष्यभर त्याच्या वेदना सहन कराव्या लागतात.. एखाद्या ठिकाणी झालेली जखम औषधोपचाराने बरी करता येते. त्यासाठी जखम स्वच्छ करणे, त्याच्यावर प्रतिबंधक औषधांचा वापर करून संसर्गाची तीव्रता कमी करता येते. परंतु, काही वेळा पायाच्या बोटांसह पाय, पावले यांना संसर्गापासून दूर ठेवण्यासाठी झाकणे अथवा मलमपट्टी करण्याची गरज असते.\n\n–          **त्वचा आणि नखांच्या समस्या**\n\n**घट्टा (पायावरील टणक झालेला कातडीचा भाग) –**\n\nमधुमेही व्यक्तींना मज्जारज्जूसंस्थेच्या रोगामुळे साधाऱण व्यक्तीच्या तुलनते कमी संवेदना जाणवतात. प्रामुख्याने वरवरचा स्पर्श, तापमान, आणि सांध्याच्या रचनेतून एखाद्या गोष्टीपासून संरक्षण करण्यासाठी व्यक्तीला संवेदना होतात. जेव्हा एखाद्या व्यक्तीच्या संवेदना नष्ट होतात तेव्हा तो आपोआप त्याचे संरक्षण हरवून बसतो. साधारण सांध्याच्या संवेदना हरवतात त्यावेळी आपोआपच सांध्यावर ताण येतो. जेव्हा पायाच्या तळव्यावर स्वतःचे ओझे उचलणे अशक्य होते वजन पेलेनासे होते. त्यावेळी ते कमजोर झालेले असतात. त्यावेळी पायांना घट्टे येतात. त्यासाठी शस्त्रक्रिया करण्याची आवश्यकता नाही. यासाठी पायांच्या तळव्यावर येणारे वजन पेलण्यासाठी विशेष प्रकारचे बूट उपलब्ध असतात. त्याचा वापर करणे कधीही उपयुक्त ठरते.\n\nमधुमेहीच्या रुग्णांना मज्जारज्जू संस्थेचा आजार जडावल्याने त्यांच्या त्वचेला रक्तपुरवठा कमी होतो. परिणामी त्यांची त्वचा सुकल्यासारखी होते. पुढे जाऊन सुकलेल्या त्वचेचे रुपांतर त्वचेला भेगा अथवा तडे जाण्यात झाल्याचे दिसून येते. त्वचेला गेलेल्या भेगांचा संसर्ग होण्याची शक्यता असते. त्यामुळे झोपायला जाण्यापूर्वी व्हॅसलिन अथवा मॉइश्चरायझरचा वापर करून त्वचेला पडलेल्या सुरकुत्या अथवा भेगा नाहीशा करणे हाच त्यावर उपाय मानला जातो.\n\n**–          नखांचा संसर्ग**\n\nनखांचा संसर्ग होण्याचा अनेकदा धोका असतो. त्यामुळे नखे कापताना व्यवस्थित कापावेत. त्याबाबतची काळजी घ्यावी. कमीत कमी नखे कापणे टाळावे. कारण  पायाची बोटांची नखे वाढतात.\n\n#### **मज्जारज्जूसंस्थेच्या आजारांचे दुखणे कोणाला** **?**\n\nप्रत्येक मधुमेहाच्या रुग्णाला मधुमेहाच्या मज्जारज्जू संस्थेचा आजार होतोच असे नाही. दीर्घकाळापर्यंत चालणाऱ्या मधुमेहाच्या रुग्णाला मज्जारज्जू संस्थेचा आजार होतो. परंतु, मज्जारज्जू संस्थेचा आजार हा साखरेच्या नियंत्रणावर आधारीत असतो.\n\n#### **मज्जारज्जूसंस्थेच्या आजारावर उपचार काय** **?**\n\nमज्जारज्जूसंस्थेचा आजार हा बरा होत नाही. एकदा हा आजार बळावला तर प्रत्येक रुग्णाने त्यामुळे होणारी गुंतागुंत होणार नाही याची काळजी घेणे अपेक्षित आहे. पायांचा अल्सरपासून मुक्तता मिळण्यासाठीच मज्जारज्जूसंस्थेच्या आजारावर उपचार करणे हाच उद्देश आहे.\n\n**तुमच्या माहितीसाठी…**\n\n**ताण** **+** **मज्जारज्जू संस्थेचा रोग** **=** **जखम**\n\nमज्जारज्जू संस्थेचा आजारावर उपचार होऊ शकतो.\n\nजखमेवर उपचार कऱण्यासाठी त्यावर येणारा दाब अथवा ताण कमी करण्याची गरज आहे. साधारण व्यक्तीला वेदना झाल्या की तो व्यक्ती स्वतःच जखमेवर येणारा ताण कमी करण्याचा प्रयत्न करतो. जखमेवर येणारी सूज देखील कमी करण्याचा प्रयत्न करतो. परंतु, असे वारंवार झाल्यास जखमा बऱ्या करणे शक्य होत नाही. पायांना होणाऱ्या जखमा बऱ्या कऱण्यासाठी अथवा त्याला संरक्षण देण्यासाठी विशेष प्रकारचे बूट वापरणे हे फायद्याचे ठरते. तसेच विशेष प्रकारचे बुटातील सोलचा वापर करणे अपेक्षित आहे.\n\n# मज्जारज्जूसंस्थेचे व्यवस्थापन उपचार करण्यापेक्षा काळजी घेतलेली बरी\n\nमज्जारज्जूचा आजार असलेल्या मधुमेहींनी पायांची काळजी घेणे अपेक्षित असल्याचे समजून घ्यावे. मज्जारज्जूसंस्थेचा आजार बळावण्याची शक्यता असलेल्या रुग्णांसाठी पायांची काळजी कशी घ्यावी हे समजावून घेणे फायद्याचे आहे.\n\n- साखर नियंत्रित ठेवा.\n- नियमित चालते रहा. पण चालताना पाय उघडे ठेवू नका.\n- कॉटनचे सॉक्स वापरा.\n- पाण्याने पाय धुतल्यानंतर ओले पाय स्वच्छ करा.\n- पायांच्या बोटातील ओला भाग तसाच ठेवल्यास त्यामुळे बुरशीचा संसर्ग होण्याचा अथवा बोटांमध्ये अर्धवट भाग ओला राहण्याची शक्यता असते.\n- पायाच्या बोटांची हातांनी तपासणी करावी. हातांप्रमाणे पायाला अथवा बोटांना संवेदना जाणवतात की नाही याचे निदान करावे.\n- रुग्णाला स्वतःचे पायाचे तळवे पाहणे शक्य नसल्याने त्याने आरशाचा वापर करून पायांची स्थिती आणि त्यावर जखमा आहेत की नाही हे तपासून पाहावे. आरशाचा वापर करून पाहणे ते सोपे ठरेल.\n- रुग्णाच्या नातेवाईकांनी दर आठवड्याला रुग्णाच्या पायाची तपासणी करावी. त्याबबात डॉक्टरांकडे पाठपुरावा करून पायाच्या रचनेत काही बदल होत आहे का किंवा कसे याबाबत तपासून घ्यावे.\n- दररोज, आठवड्याने अथवा महिन्याने नेमके काय फरक जाणवतो ते पाहावे.\n- पायाला कठीण भेगा अथवा चिरा पडल्याचे दिसतात का ते तपासा.\n- एकदा झोपायला तुम्ही गेला तर त्यावेळी पायांना सुरकुत्या पडल्या असतील तर त्या मॉयश्चरायझर अथवा व्हॅसलिनचा वापर केला पाहिजे.\n- पायाच्या चपला, बूट नियमित तपासा. तुटलेल्या चपला, बूटामुळे देखील पायांना जखमा होण्याची शक्यता अधिक असते.\n- पायाच्या योग्य आकाराचा बूट अथवा चपला वापरा. शक्यता रात्रीच्या वेळा पायाच्या आकाराचा बूट, चपला खरेदी कारण रात्रीच्या वेळेला पाय सूजतात.\n- पायाच्या बोटांच्या ठिकाणी निमुळता आकार होत गेलेले बूट, चपला घेणे टाळा.\n- पायाला घट्टे अथवा चिरा झाल्यास त्या काढून टाकण्याचा स्वतःहून प्रयत्न करू नका. अनेकदा ते काढून टाकण्याची आवश्यकता देखील नसते.\n- अनेकदा खरेदी केलेल्या बुटाचा तळवा वजनामुळे पसरट होतो. त्यामुळे ते बरे होण्यास फायद्याचे ठरते.\n- अनेक वेळा घरात निर्जंतुकीकरण नसल्याच्या कारणामुळे संसर्ग होण्याचा धोका अधिक असतो.\n- धूम्रपान टाळा. धुम्रपान आणि मधुमेह हे सर्वात चुकीचे समीकरण आहे. ते घातक ही ठरू शकते.\n\n#### **मधुमेहींमध्ये मज्जारज्जूंच्या आजारांची कोणती गुंतागुंत होऊ शकते** **?**\n\n- बहुतांश वेळा जखमा बऱ्या होत नाहीत. काही महिन्यांपासून ते वर्षभरापर्यंत त्या तशाच राहतात.\n- संसर्गामुळे अस्थिमगजाचा दाह –हाडाच्या आतील बाजूपर्यंत संसर्ग होण्याची शक्यता अधिक असते.\n- पाय, पायाची बोटे, तळवे हे सातत्याने सॉक्स, मोजे वापरून झाकून ठेवणे आवश्यक असते. अन्यथा कधी कधी पायाची बोटे, पायाचा काही भाग अथवा पाय सुद्धा काढून पुढील आयुष्यासाठी काढून टाकण्याशिवाय पर्याय नसतो.\n\nमज्जारज्जूसंस्थेच्या गुंतागुंतीबाबत सातत्याने जागृत राहणे हे गरजेचे असते. त्या करिता पायांची नियमित तपासणी आवश्यक आहे. यामुळे मधुमेहींना होणाऱ्या मज्जारज्जूसंस्थेच्या आजारांपासून दूर राहू शकतो.\n\n![Dr.Milind

        "markdown": "Does it seem almost impossible for you to go about your day without feeling excruciating pain in your back? Or does bending over to pick up something feel like torture? You may be suffering from chronic back pain.\n\nWhile lower back pain or upper back pain is a fairly common condition that most people face irrespective of age, persistent back pain may result from various underlying causes. The most common pain that people experience is lower back pain, shoulder pain, or muscle strains in the back. However, before finding out the cause and treatment for back pain, let us first understand the different kinds of [back pain](https://sanchetihospital.org/spine-surgery-department/).\n\n**Types of back pain**\n\n1) **Acute Back Pain**: Sudden sharp or acute pain in the back results from an injury to the muscles or ligaments. An injury causing a fracture to the spine or a tear in the muscle fibres may give rise to acute back pain. This generally does not heal without seeking immediate medical help.\n\n2) **Chronic Back Pain**: Having persistent back pain, whether in the upper or lower half of your back which refuses to go away, can be called chronic. While it is more common with increasing age, conditions like arthritis of the spine are a leading cause of chronic back pain.\n\n3) **Lumbar Radicular Pain**: Lumbar radicular pain in the back is of the more severe kind and happens to an injury to the nerve roots of the lumbar spine. The pain feels like a highly intense, stabbing pain from the lower back to the leg, causing numbness and tingling.\n\n**How Does Back Pain Become a Chronic Illness?**: Since back pain is a common condition, many people neglect it, assuming that it will heal independently. However, prolonged periods of ignored back pain may convert into chronic illness if you don’t seek timely medical help.\n\nThe onset of back pain may be due to accidents, acute sports injuries, workplace injuries, improper lifting practices, or weak back muscles. Pregnancy is also a significant factor for back pain amongst women. While these conditions need proper medical attention, there could also be underlying causes like tumours in the spine, arthritis, and the likes, which need urgent medical care.\n\n**What is the symptom of back pain?**:\n\nWhile back pain on its own may keep recurring due to various causes, that which continues to trouble you and makes your daily activities difficult may show symptoms at its onset. Be observant about symptoms like-\n\n– Numbness or Tingling\n\n– Excruciating pain, especially at night\n\n– Weakness\n\n– Radial pain shooting down the leg\n\n– Unexplained weight loss\n\n**What causes back pain?**: The most common causes of back pain are accidents and injuries due to sports. However, poor posture and long hours of sitting affect your back and weaken the muscles. Since the shoulder and neck muscles are connected, stress could be another cause of pain in the shoulder and back muscles.\n\nWhile most pains go away with good exercise and warm compressions, cause for concern rises if there are symptoms of chronic illnesses like spinal tumours, arthritis, sciatica, spondylitis, etc. Such severe conditions may require back surgeries to heal completely. If you’re looking for the best chronic back pain treatment hospitals, [Sancheti Hospital, Pune](https://sanchetihospital.org/spine-surgery-department/), is an excellent one. With well-qualified and famous surgeons, you can rest assured about the well-being of your back.\n\n**How to prevent back pain?**: Making a few changes and incorporating them into your daily life will go a long way in helping you ease your back pain. While seeking professional medical help is extremely important, it is also essential that you take the initiative to maintain good health and thus keep chronic illnesses and aches and pains at bay. Here are some ways to prevent or ease your back pain-\n\n1. Exercise\n2. Build muscle strength and flexibility\n3. Maintain a healthy weight\n4. Quit smoking\n5. Avoid lifting heavy objects\n6. Correct your posture\n7. Ensure your back is comfortable with good support when sitting\n\n**People also ask**:\n\n1. How do I know if my back pain is serious?While most back pains are harmless and are no cause for alarm, you should seek immediate medical attention if there are symptoms like high fever, stomach discomfort, sudden shooting pain in the back, unexplainable weight loss, and reduced bladder function.\n2. What organs can cause lower back pain?Sudden pain in the lower back may result from poor functioning of organs like kidneys, appendix, pancreas, and large intestines. Since they are near the lower back area, disruption in their function may come out as one of the symptoms of lower back pain.\n3. How can I fix my back?Most of your back pain problems will go away with proper exercising and releasing the muscles. Unknowingly we harbour tension in our muscles, which reflects as back or shoulder pain. With correct posture and good low-impact exercises, you can fix your back pain. However, if the pain is persistent, it is best to seek medical help.\n4. What is the best medicine for back pain?An Ibuprofen or Tylenol are pain-relievers which may give you temporary relief from your nagging back pain. However, it is best if you do not self-diagnose and visit a doctor to get appropriate and adequate professional care for your chronic back pain. Visiting the best hospitals like Sancheti Hospital, Pune, will help you diagnose the underlying cause and get timely treatment.\n\n#### Did you like this?

        "markdown": "**Recognizing the Signs of Stroke: BE FAST**\n\nEvery year, millions of people worldwide experience strokes, making it one of the leading causes of disability and death. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. This sudden disruption can have devastating consequences, impacting a person’s ability to move, speak, and even think. Consequently, stroke is rightly regarded as a medical emergency that demands swift and decisive action.\n\nThe urgency in addressing stroke lies in its potential to cause irreversible damage to the brain. Brain cells begin to die within minutes of a stroke, underscoring the critical need for timely intervention. Recognizing the signs and symptoms of stroke can be the difference between life and death, between independence and disability. Therefore, increasing awareness about stroke and understanding its warning signs is paramount in our collective efforts to combat this debilitating condition.\n\nAs we delve deeper into the intricacies of stroke, exploring its causes, treatment options, and preventive measures, it becomes apparent that knowledge truly is power. By arming ourselves with information about stroke, we empower individuals, families, and communities to take proactive steps towards stroke prevention and to respond effectively in the event of an emergency. In the following sections, we will unravel the complexities of stroke, shedding light on its multifaceted nature and equipping readers with the tools they need to navigate this challenging terrain.\n\n**Causes of Stroke**\n\nStroke is a complex medical condition that arises from the interruption or reduction of blood flow to the brain, leading to the impairment or death of brain cells. This interruption can occur for various reasons, resulting in two main types of stroke: ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.\n\n**Ischemic Stroke:** This type of stroke occurs when a blood vessel supplying the brain becomes blocked or narrowed, restricting blood flow to a specific part of the brain. The blockage is typically caused by a blood clot or plaque buildup in the blood vessels, a condition known as atherosclerosis. Without adequate blood supply, brain cells begin to suffer from oxygen and nutrient deprivation, leading to tissue damage or death.\n\n**Hemorrhagic Stroke:** Unlike ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures or leaks, causing bleeding into the surrounding tissue. This bleeding can result from various factors, including high blood pressure, aneurysms (weakness in blood vessel walls), arteriovenous malformations (abnormal connections between arteries and veins), or head trauma. The presence of blood in the brain can exert pressure on surrounding tissue, leading to further damage and neurological deficits.\n\n**BE FAST:**\n\nBE FAST serves as a mnemonic device to aid in the recognition of stroke symptoms and prompt action. By remembering this acronym, individuals can quickly assess whether someone may be experiencing a stroke and seek timely medical attention:\n\n– **B: Balance:** Sudden loss of balance or coordination can indicate a stroke. Individuals may experience difficulty walking or maintaining their balance, often without any apparent cause.\n\n**-E: Eyes:** Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes is another warning sign of stroke. This may manifest as blurred vision, double vision, or even complete vision loss in one eye.\n\n**-F: Face:** Sudden weakness or drooping on one side of the face is a classic symptom of stroke. This facial droop may affect the mouth, causing a lopsided smile or difficulty in fully closing one eye.\n\n**-A: Arms:** Sudden weakness or numbness in one arm, particularly on one side of the body, can indicate a stroke. Individuals may struggle to raise their arm or maintain a firm grip on objects.\n\n**-S: Speech:** Sudden difficulty speaking or understanding speech is a common symptom of stroke. This may manifest as slurred speech, difficulty forming words, or trouble comprehending language.\n\n**-T: Time:** Time is of the essence when it comes to stroke. If any of these symptoms are observed, it is crucial to call emergency services immediately and seek medical attention without delay. Rapid intervention can significantly improve outcomes and minimize long-term disability.\n\n**Treatment of Stroke**\n\n**-Time Sensitivity:** When it comes to stroke treatment, time is of paramount importance. The phrase “Time is brain” underscores the critical need for swift action. The longer blood flow is disrupted to the brain, the greater the risk of irreversible brain damage. Therefore, recognizing the signs of stroke and seeking immediate medical attention is crucial.\n\n**-Medications:** The specific treatment approach for stroke depends on the type and severity of the stroke. In the case of ischemic stroke, where a blood clot blocks a blood vessel supplying the brain, medications such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) or thrombolytics may be administered to dissolve the clot and restore blood flow. These clot-busting drugs are most effective when given within a few hours of the onset of symptoms.\n\n**-Surgery:** In some cases of hemorrhagic stroke, where bleeding occurs within the brain, surgical intervention may be necessary to repair the blood vessel and stop the bleeding. This may involve procedures such as aneurysm clipping, coiling, or arteriovenous malformation (AVM) removal, depending on the underlying cause of the bleeding.\n\n**-Rehabilitation:** Stroke recovery does not end with acute medical intervention; it is a journey that often requires ongoing rehabilitation to regain lost function and maximize independence. Rehabilitation programs are tailored to the individual needs of stroke survivors and may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. Physical therapy aims to improve mobility, strength, and coordination, helping individuals regain control over their movements and reduce the risk of falls. Occupational therapy focuses on relearning everyday tasks such as dressing, bathing, and cooking, adapting the environment to accommodate any physical limitations. Speech therapy addresses communication difficulties and swallowing problems that may arise as a result of stroke, helping individuals regain their ability to speak clearly and safely consume food and liquids.\n\n**Precautions and Prevention**\n\n**– Healthy Lifestyle:** Adopting a healthy lifestyle is essential for stroke prevention. This includes maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins while limiting saturated fats, cholesterol, and sodium. A healthy diet can help control weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels, reducing the risk of stroke.\n\n**– Regular Exercise:** Regular physical activity is crucial for maintaining cardiovascular health and reducing the risk of stroke. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise each week, as recommended by health guidelines. Exercise can help lower blood pressure, improve circulation, and promote overall well-being.\n\n**– Smoking Cessation:** Smoking is a significant risk factor for stroke, as it damages blood vessels and increases the likelihood of blood clots. Quitting smoking can dramatically reduce the risk of stroke and improve overall health. Support resources and smoking cessation programs are available to help individuals quit smoking and maintain a smoke-free lifestyle.\n\n**– Limit Alcohol Intake:** Excessive alcohol consumption can contribute to high blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and other risk factors for stroke. Limiting alcohol intake to moderate levels—defined as up to one drink per day for women and up to two drinks per day for men—can help lower the risk of stroke and promote cardiovascular health.\n\n**– Manage Chronic Conditions:** Conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and high cholesterol significantly increase the risk of stroke. Managing these conditions through medication, lifestyle modifications, and regular monitoring can help control risk factors and prevent stroke.\n\n**– Regular Check-ups:** Regular check-ups with a healthcare provider are essential for monitoring and managing risk factors for stroke. Routine screenings for blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other cardiovascular risk factors can help identify issues early and take appropriate measures to prevent stroke.\n\nIn conclusion, staying informed about stroke and its warning signs is paramount for everyone’s well-being. By familiarizing ourselves with the BE FAST acronym and understanding the importance of swift action, we can play a proactive role in preventing strokes and mitigating their impact. Empowering ourselves and our communities with knowledge about stroke empowers us to recognize its signs promptly and seek timely medical attention, potentially saving lives and minimizing long-term disability.\n\nMoreover, advocating for stroke awareness and prevention initiatives within our communities can have a profound impact on public health outcomes. By spreading awareness about the risk factors for stroke and promoting healthy lifestyle habits, we can collectively work towards a future free from the burden of stroke-related disabilities. Together, let us prioritize stroke prevention, empower individuals to take control of their health, and foster a supportive environment where everyone is equipped to recognize and respond to stroke effectively. Through concerted efforts and education, we can pave the way for a healthier, stroke-free future for generations to come.\n\n#### Did you like this?

        "markdown": "Have you lately been finding it difficult to climb a couple of stairs without taking breaks? Or do winters feel like torture to your joints, especially your knees? You may be suffering from chronic knee pain instead of temporary [knee pain](https://sanchetihospital.org/joint-replacement-department/).\n\nWhile temporary pain may be due to a knee injury, constant knee pain results from underlying causes. Even though many people experience knee joint pain, chronic knee swelling and pain affects explicitly those in the older age bracket.\n\nBefore we delve into discussing chronic knee pain treatment, let us understand what causes it and how you can avoid it.\n\n**What is chronic knee pain?**: Chronic knee pain is long-term pain due to an unhealed knee injury, trauma, or other underlying health conditions. When your injury refuses to heal, or the trauma to your knee joint is such that it requires constant medical attention, the pain may remain persistent or chronic and causes swelling and sensitivity to the knees.\n\n**What causes chronic knee pain?**: The knee joint is the point of connection for the shinbone, thigh bone, and knee cap. Any injury to either of these can cause an indirect impact on the knee joint. Some common causes of trauma to the knees are accidents, gout and infections, damaged cartilage, falling from a height, build-up of uric acid, sport or workout injuries, and much more. Some of these may result in dull or minor knee pain; however, when the chronic knee pain is also unbearably extreme, there may be cause for some concern.\n\nBone tumours usually cause extreme knee pain that refuses to go away. Suppose you notice that your chronic knee pain has spread to other bones of your body. In that case, there is a possibility of bone disorder conditions like osteoarthritis or osteoporosis.\n\n**What are the symptoms of chronic knee pain?**: During the onset of chronic knee pain, some symptoms accompany the initial dull ache in your knees. Be on the lookout for symptoms like muscle cramps, constant aching, pain due to movement, redness, tenderness and swelling of the joints, stiffness and weakness in the legs, reduced range of motion, and constant dull burning discomfort.\n\nWhile most people will experience only a couple of these symptoms for their pain, some might even experience a majority or all of them as the pain increases over time. However, ensure that you do not delay seeking medical help and consult your doctor at the earliest.\n\n**How to prevent chronic knee pain?**: Some ways to keep your chronic knee pain or injuries at bay-\n\n1) **Warm-up before workout**: One of the most common trauma causes to the knee joints is suddenly working out without proper warm-up. This shocks the leg muscles and gives them no time to prepare to bear the stress of exercise. Have a good 10 minutes of warm-up before working out to prevent injuries.\n\n2) **Low-impact exercises**: Go easy on your workout. When you know there is a risk of injury or overdoing the exercises, it is best to keep them low-impact and avoid further complications.\n\n3) **Maintain appropriate weight**: Shedding the extra weight may be beneficial in more ways than one. Maintaining appropriate weight eases the strain on your leg muscles to bear your body weight, thus keeping them comfortable.\n\n4) **Intake of nutrition**: Chronic knee pain may be a sign of declining nutrition and vitamins. Ensure eating a well-balanced meal and supplementing it with Vitamin D, B and Zinc to strengthen your bones.\n\n5) **Wear comfortable footwear**: Footwear impacts our legs more than we can imagine. Wearing strenuous and uncomfortable footwear puts unnecessary pressure on the legs and causes the muscles and tendons to strain. Get yourself suitable footwear to avoid all leg or knee-related problems.\n\n6) **Get support**: When you notice that the dull pain in your knees that you tried to ignore for a long time refuses to go away, it may be time for you to seek medical help. Injuries to the knees can only worsen if left neglected for a long time.\n\nIf you’re looking for the best place to treat your chronic knee pain or injury, Sancheti Hospital, Pune, is excellent. With the best surgeons and orthopaedics, your knee pain will surely heal and vanish!\n\n**People also Ask**:\n\n1\\. How do you treat chronic knee pain?: If you want to try some home remedies apart from visiting a doctor, resting your knee well is the most helpful. Keep it at an elevated position while resting to ensure proper blood flow. You can also use hot compressions to reduce pain and cold compressions to reduce swelling and redness.\n\n2\\. How do I know if my knee pain is serious?: While some knee pains may be temporary, ones that can be serious are those resulting from accidents, falls, wounds, etc. If you notice a deformity or swelling and redness that won’t subside, you should immediately visit your doctor.\n\n3\\. Can chronic knee pain be cured?: Since chronic knee pain may result from several underlying conditions, you cannot usually treat it on your own. However, seeking medical help at the best hospitals like [Sancheti Hospital, Pune](https://sanchetihospital.org/2020/02/14/osteoarthritis-patient/), will help cure your chronic pain and relieve you.\n\n4\\. How do I know I need a knee replacement?: When you have knee pain that restricts your daily activities or persists even in your resting position throughout the day, it is possible that your knees need replacement. Conditions like osteoarthritis may damage your knee joints and make movement difficult.\n\n#### Did you like this?
